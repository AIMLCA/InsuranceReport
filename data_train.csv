"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Property Manager to which the following was noted:



Rear Verandah



At the time of our inspection, we noted the rear verandah area about the northern elevation of the subject property has a distinctive decline towards the external edge. Images 2 – 4



We measured the decline within the verandah floor to be approximately 2.9 degrees. Image 5


When short-term subsidence and movement occurs, specific indicators are also expected to be observed within the surrounding structures such as internal and external wall linings, timber framing and timber handrail etc inclusive of the following:



Displacement and possible dislodgement of the timber handrail components. 


Displacement of the timber floor sheeting.



Gaps between paintwork and adjoining elements.



Significant displacement and dislodgement of the timber fascia about the edge.



Significant displacement and cracking within the external wall linings.


Cracks and gaps appear fresh without build-up of debris.



From our observations, we noted no evidence of the aforementioned specific indicators of sudden and abrupt movement about the rear verandah area. Images 6 – 8



As such, in our opinion the observed decline within the rear verandah area is attributable to gradual settlement over an extended period of time (years).



Furthermore, we also noted the timber framing members about the northern elevation of the subject property are in a significantly deteriorated condition including substantial wet rot and sectional loss. Images 9 & 10





We confirm that wet rot occurs as a result of on-going and long-term moisture exposure causing the timber to gradually decay and lose structural integrity.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed damage about the rear verandah area has been ongoing for an extended period of time (years) and unrelated to any single one-off event. 





Bathroom / Kitchen



We noted evidence of a water leak within the wall cavity dividing the kitchen and bathroom areas. Images 11 & 12



At the time of our inspection, internal access to the bathroom area was not possible as the doorway had been boarded up. Image 13



The Property Manager advised that the bathroom has been boarded up and not used for some time.



Given the evidence of water during our inspection, in our opinion, it is likely the escape of liquid is attributable to a leak within the pipework about the wall cavity.



However, we recommend a plumber be engaged to carry out a leak detection to confirm.



From our observations, it was evident that the water leak has been occurring for an extended period of time (months). Image 14



In saying this, the observed escape of liquid about the kitchen and bathroom dividing wall is unrelated to the claimed damage about the rear verandah.",NA,"Subsequent to our inspection, we can confirm a distinctive decline towards the external elevation was evident within the rear verandah area about the northern elevation of the subject property.



At the time of our inspection, we noted no evidence of specific indicators of sudden and abrupt movement about the rear verandah area.



As such, in our opinion the observed decline within the rear verandah area is attributable to gradual settlement over an extended period of time (years).



We also noted significant deterioration including wet rot and sectional loss within the timber framing members.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed damage about the rear verandah area has been ongoing for an extended period of time (years) and unrelated to any single one-off event. 



A water leak was also evident within the dividing wall between the kitchen and bathroom areas and appears to have been occurring for an extended period of time (months).



Given the bathroom has not been used for some time, it is likely the escape of liquid is a result of a leak within the water pipework.



However, we recommend a plumber be engaged to carry out a leak detection to confirm.



In saying this, the observed escape of liquid about the kitchen and bathroom dividing wall is unrelated to the claimed damage about the rear verandah."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following was noted:



Provided Advice

From our onsite discussions with the Insured, the following was advised:



The Insured first noticed a gradual increase to their water bill over a period of approximately nine (9) months.



Finally, the Insured advised there was a significant increase to their water bill after the gradual increase, to which the Insured engaged a plumber to investigate the cause of the increased water bill. 



The plumber undertook invasive investigation works within the bathroom to which it was found that hot water pipework embedded within the bathroom slab was leaking. 



Subsequently the plumber installed new pipework between the hot water unit and internal water services, making existing leaking pipework redundant.



The plumber also undertook inspection within the subfloor and noted that the subfloor was wet. 



We acknowledge receipt of the following invoices from Alltrades Contracting Services PTY LTD:



Invoice No. 00410166 dated 11-10-2021, for leak detection works. 



Invoice No. 00410478 dated 14-10-2021, for the installation of new pipework.



During our inspection, the Insured alluded to damage throughout the property which has been claimed to be a result of the subject leaking pipe, which has been outlined below. 




s



The following is to be read in conjunction with the provided Schematic Floorplan of the subject property provided under Appendix A.



Bathroom



From inspection within the Bathroom, we noted the following (Images 2 – 7):



Partial demolition of the bathroom tiles in facilitating the pipework reinstatement. 



Partial demolition of the bathroom wall render in facilitating the pipework reinstatement.



Removal of the bathroom vanity in facilitating the pipework reinstatement.



Moisture damage to the wall render and paintwork to the bathroom partition walls (dining room side of the bathroom). 



High moisture content & wet rot damage to the bathroom door architraves.



Dining Room, Bedroom 3 & Bedroom 4



From inspection within the Dining Room, Bedroom 3 & Bedroom 4, we noted the following:



Dining Room



Moisture damage to the wall paint and render, mainly about the partition wall between the Dining room and Bedroom 3 & Bedroom 4. Images 9 – 10



High moisture content and wet rot damage to the architraves and skirtings within the Dining room. Image 11



Bedroom 3



Moisture damage to the wall paint and render including mould growth to the wall render, mainly about the partition wall between Bedroom 3 & Dining room and Bedroom 3 & Bedroom 4. Images 12 – 14



High moisture content readings to the render within Bedroom 3. Images 15 – 16



Mould spots to the cornices and wall, mainly about the external wall of Bedroom 3. 

Images 17 – 18

Bedroom 4



Moisture damage to the wall paint and render including mould growth to the wall render, mainly about the partition wall between the Bedroom 4 & Dining room. Images 19 – 20



Wet rot and high moisture content readings to the skirting within Bedroom 4. Images 21 – 22



Bedroom 1



The sliding door servicing the built-in wardrobe within Bedroom 1 has reduced functionality. Images 23



External



From external inspection of the subject property, we noted the following:



Eastern Elevation (Image 24)



Damage to render in facilitating the pipework reinstatement. Image 25



Cracking within the render on the Eastern elevation, inclusive of cracking propagating from the Kitchen window. Images 26 – 28



Front Patio



Cracking to the pebblecrete finish about the front patio floor and stairs. 

Images 29 – 30



Cracking to the pebblecrete finish about the front entry door. Image 31 



Separation and cracking between front patio and dwelling, resulting in delamination of render. Image 32



Separation and cracking between the Front Patio balustrade and main dwelling. Image 33













Subfloor



From inspection within the subfloor, we noted the following (Images 34 – 36):



Subfloor was in a damp state. 



No evidence of any damp proof course (DPC) within the brickwork to mitigate rising damp. 



Fretting to brickwork.



From the Insureds provided imagery, we also noted that the floorboards adjacent to the bathroom were moisture affected. Image 37","Proximate Cause of Damage

Bathroom & External Wall Adjacent to Bathroom



It is clearly evidence that in facilitating the investigation and reinstatement of leaking plumbing that the bathroom required partial demolition. 



As such, we consider that the removal of tiles and render within the bathroom was required in facilitating investigation and replacement of the leaking pipework. 



Given the above, we confirm that in ensuring warrantable reinstatement of the bathroom, that all tiles will be required to be removed in facilitating the waterproofing replacement. 



In addition to the above, we also noted that the render about the Eastern external wall had been damaged in facilitating the reinstatement of new pipework, which will be required to be reinstated and painted.



Moisture Damaged Render & Wet Rot to Architraves & Skirting



From review of the moisture damage to the paintwork and render, and wet rot to the architraves & skirtings about the Dining Room, Bedroom 3 & Bedroom 4, we note that the damage does not appear fresh in nature and has evidently been occurring over an extended period of time in years.



The high moisture content readings undertaken clearly indicate that there is a rising damp issue within the brickwork.

We also confirm that we did not observe any damp proof course provisions within the subfloor to mitigate rising damp.



We further noted fretting to brickwork within the subfloor area consistent with long-term rising damp and moisture exposure indicating on-going rising damp issues.  



Given the above, in our opinion, the moisture damage to the paintwork, render and wet rot to skirting and architraves as outlined within this report is a result of long-term rising damp due to omission or defective damp proof course and pre-dates the subject leaking pipe event.



As such, the rising damp damage is considered unrelated to the subject leaking pipe event but rather a result of inherent construction issues.



Mould Spots Within Bedroom 3



We note that the mould spots within Bedroom 3 was evident on the mainly about the external wall.



We further consider that the mould spots are outside of the zone of influence of the subject leaking pipe.



Based on our observations, in our opinion, the observed mould spots within Bedroom 3 is consistent with long-term moisture ingress within the eaves adjacent to Bedroom 3 and insufficient ventilation within Bedroom 3 and pre-dates the subject leaking pipe event.



Given the above, we consider that the mould spots within Bedroom 3 is unrelated to the subject leaking pipe event.



Bedroom1 Built-in Robe Sliding Door



From inspection of the ceiling lining and wall lining adjacent to the built-in robe, we confirm we did not observe any indication that the underlying footings has undergone movement due to moisture within the subfloor area caused by the leaking pipe.



In our opinion, the reduced functionality of the built-in robe sliding door is consistent with long-term general wear and tear and is unrelated and pre-dates the subject leaking pipe event.





Cracking to the Eastern Wall



From review of the external brickwork and render, we confirm that we did not observe any control joints to allow for on-going thermal movement within the brickwork and render.



The observed crack pattern is consistent with long-term thermal movement within the underlying brickwork and render and omission of sufficient control joints to account of on-going thermal movement. 



As such, in our opinion, the external cracking to the eastern wall is unrelated to and pre-dates the subject leaking pipe event.



Cracking to the Front Patio Floor



From our review of the Front Patio floor cracking, the face of the cracking does not appear fresh and has evidently occurred over an extended period of time in years. 



The pattern and mechanism of the observed cracking is consistent with plastic shrinkage cracks. 



Plastic shrinkage cracking results in the concrete when poured and subsequently not controlled during the curing process. This is evident with the three-branch intersecting cracking configuration which was present.  



This type of crack formation indicates rapid loss of water due to evaporation rate exceeding the bleeding rate. 



In our opinion, the observed cracking within the front patio pebblecrete surface is a pre-existing damage which resulted from poor concrete curing at the time of construction, unrelated to any defined insurable event or the leaking pipe event. 



As such, in our opinion, the observed cracking to the patio floor is consistent with inherent construction issues and concrete shrinkage cracks and is unrelated to and pre-dates the claimed leaking pipe event.















Separation and Cracking Between the Front Patio & Dwelling



From our review of the Front Patio separation and cracking, the face of the cracking does not appear fresh in nature and has evidently occurred over an extended period of time in years. 



We note that the main dwelling and front patio are supported off differing footing systems. 



In addition to the above, from review of historical Google Street View imagery of the property, we noted between 2009 and 2021 that vegetation planted adjacent to the patio had increase significant in size.



From review of the separation and crack pattern, in our opinion, the separation and cracking is a result of long-term and gradual differential movement and subsidence due to differing footing systems and foundation movement caused by long-term vegetation growth adjacent to the patio. 



Given the above, the separation and cracking between the front patio and dwelling is considered unrelated to and pre-dates the claimed leaking pipe event.



Subfloor Dampness



We note that the subfloor was in a damp state at the time of our inspection. 



In our opinion, the subfloor dampness is due to the omission of sufficient subfloor ventilation, to which the dampness has been exacerbated by the subject leaking pipe event.



Notwithstanding the above, we consider that the subfloor will return to normal moisture levels within 6 – 12 months. 



However, we recommend that the subfloor ventilation be upgraded through the installation of additional vents and/or installation of a mechanical ventilation system. 



Brickwork Fretting



The observed brickwork fretting within the subfloor is consistent with omission or defective damp proof course and long-term rising damp. 


Given the above, in our opinion, the brickwork fretting is a result of inherent construction issues and is unrelated to and pre-dates the subject leaking pipe event.





Moisture Affected Floorboards



From review of the provided imagery, we noted that the floorboards are evidently moisture affected adjacent to the bathroom.



With consideration to the wet rot to the bathroom architraves and skirting boards adjacent to the bathroom, there is evidence of previous waterproofing failure within the bathroom. 



Based on the above, in our opinion, the observed water staining is consistent with long-term gradual moisture ingress due to bathroom waterproofing failure and is unrelated to any one-off or insurable event.","In summarising the observed damage and proximate causation, we provide the following table.

Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following damage was noted:

Leaking Pipe



According to the Insured’s advice, the leaking sprinkler manifold is located about the front elevation abutting the existing brick pavers. Image 2



Insured advised that initially upon noticing subsidence within the brick pavers and compromised doors/windows, they engaged a plumber who identified the aforesaid sprinkler manifold had been leaking.



Subsequently, the Insured noted the numerous damage within the entire property, which has progressively been exacerbated with time.

External



We noted evidence of subsidence and movement within the brick pavers along the eastern (front) and northern elevations. Images 3 - 8



The Insured noted movement to the posts supporting the canopy, which also resulted in the separation of the canopy roof from the building's external brick walls. Images 9 & 10



From our inspection, we noted evidence of movement and rotation within the aforementioned columns.



In addition, we noted the posts have sustained long-term corrosion with evidence of material loss about the base.



Moreover, from our external inspection, no evidence of cracking to the external brickwork, with distinct diagonal tapered cracking at the base, particularly in the area adjacent to the pipe leak, which is an indication of short-term foundation subsidence was noted. Image 11 - 16

As previously mentioned, at this stage, we are not privy to the details of the plumbing report which has been requested but not received to date.



As such, we have made our inference on the cause of observed damage based on our visual non-destructive inspection and our structural assessment with reference to general engineering principles and current Australian Standards.



Should we receive a plumbing report, we will review our findings against the plumbers report and revert back with a revised report accordingly.



Damage Related to the Pipe Leak 

Subsidence to the Brick Pavers – Adjacent to the Leaking Pipe



From our inspection, we noted the pavers are laid directly on natural ground.



In saying this, the pavers are inherently susceptible to differential movement as a result of inadequate subgrade compaction at the time of construction, in combination with cyclic foot traffic over an extended period of time. 



Moreover, we noted a lack of adequate drainage provision within the pavers, during general rainfalls, stormwater can permeate between brick pavers and over time, substrate material has been subject to cyclic saturation resulting in loss of bearing capacity.



In saying that, the cause of damage and subsidence within the brick pavers, are pre-existing in origin and attributable to inherent inadequate construction issues as outlined above.



However, in our opinion, it is plausible that the subsidence to the brick pavers within close proximity of the leaking pipe, predominantly the pavers along the front (eastern) elevation adjacent to the leaking sprinkler manifold, have exacerbated as a result of the escape of water.



In saying that, in our opinion, the subsidence of the pavers within the “zone of Influence” of the leaking pipe, corresponding to the front (eastern) elevation has been exacerbated by the reported leaking pipe. 



For clarity, we have provided an annotated sketch under Appendix A, highlighting the extent of pavers, which in our opinion, have been exacerbated by the leaking pipe.

Damage Unrelated to the Pipe Leak 

Movement to the Canopy Structure



In our opinion, the movement within the columns supporting the canopy structure is pre-existing in origin and consistent with the long-term settlement of the existing footing system due to erosion of supporting soil and loss of bearing capacity, over an extended period of time.



In addition, we noted the current construction of the canopy structural framework, does not provide adequate lateral restraint, which can result in rotation of the slender columns subject to cyclic wind loading over time.



Considering the above, in our opinion, the observed movement and rotation to the canopy columns are pre-existing in origin and attributed to the combination of the above factors, and are unrelated to the reported leaking pipe.



Internal Damage



In our opinion, the observed damage within other areas of the dwelling is not consistent with damage due to the claimed leaking pipe on the following basis:



The dwelling has been constructed over a concrete slab on-ground which is not susceptible to differential ground movement due to its continuous rigid, raft function over the foundation material.



The internal damage, in our opinion, was well outside of the expected influence zone that could be expected to affect a rigid slab on ground construction from the claimed leaking pipe.



No damage and subsidence to the concrete slab-on-ground were evident which would be expected as a result of building movement due to the leaking pipe.  



Moreover, no evidence of diagonal (45° angle) tapered cracking within the base of the external brick walls were noted, which would be expected to occur as a result of foundation subsidence due to the experienced pipe leak.



We refer to an extract from Practical Guide to Diagnosing Structural Movement in Buildings for Leaking Drains and Water Discharge Near to Buildings, attached in Appendix B, which acknowledges that leaking pipework can be a cause of localised subsidence.



The observed cracks occurred consistently throughout the dwelling and not propagating from a particular area about the leaking pipe.



The observed damage within the internal building fabrics is consistent with general building movement due to thermal expansion and contraction of building fabrics. 



In our opinion, the cause of the aforementioned damage at the subject property is not a result of the leaking pipe along the front side of the dwelling.



Conversely, the observed damage is consistent with long-term general building movement and foundation reactivity and other factors unrelated to the leaking pipe or any single insurable event.



In our opinion, the observed damage is superficial in nature and not demeaning to the overall structural integrity of the dwelling.



On this basis, the observed damage can be repaired accordingly without structural repairs or structural underpinning works.","Qualifications:

Damage Related to the Pipe Leak 

Subsidence to the Brick Pavers – Adjacent to the Leaking Pipe



As detailed within the body of this report, in our opinion, the cause of damage and subsidence within the brick pavers, are pre-existing in origin and attributable to inherent inadequate construction issues.

"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following was noted:



In schematically illustrating the damaged areas affected by the escape of liquid, we provided Figure 2 below highlighting the elements and areas of sustained water damage.









Figure 2- Schematic Plan of Subject Property

We acknowledge receipt of the following information provided by the Insured: 

Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, dated 12 September 2022



ZIGZ Plumbing Solutions Tax Invoice 2241, dated 28 November 2022 





At the time of our inspection, we note the Bathroom was locked and therefore we were unable to inspect this area.  



From the onsite provided advice, the subject property was purchased as an investment property and therefore the property has been vacant since the purchase settlement approximately one (1) month prior to the claimed event. 

Internal Resultant Water Damage

From our onsite inspection and assessment, we note the following findings:



Living room ground floor



A section of the plasterboard ceiling has collapsed, corresponding with Bedroom 1 located directly above. Images 2 - 3



Mould growth and water staining to the plasterboard ceiling and wall linings and cornice. Images 4 - 5



Disengagement to the timber trim about the window reveal, not consistent with water damage. Image 6



Pre-existing deterioration to the timber window reveal, not consistent with water damage. Image 7



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, no evidence of water damage was noted. 



In our opinion, the observed damage to the plasterboard ceiling and wall lining and cornice is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite. 



Entry



Mould growth and water staining to the plasterboard ceiling and wall linings and cornice was observed, corresponding with Bedroom 2 and the Hallway. Images 8 - 9



Bowing to the plasterboard ceiling was noted. Image 10



Water staining was sighted to the timber skirting boards. Image 11



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, evidence of lateral damp was noted to the Entry internal walls, indicating cavity bridge, plumbing leak or an undetected leak.



Additionally, the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report notes evidence of falling damp to the Entry internal walls, indicating defective roofing, roof flashings or faulty waterproofing membrane. 



Given the above, there is evidence of pre-existing damp the wall linings, indicating pre-existing moisture issues within the subject property. 



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the observed water damage to the plasterboard ceiling and wall linings, cornice and skirting boards is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite.  



Garage



Mould growth and water staining to the plasterboard ceiling and wall linings and cornice was observed, corresponding with Bedroom 3 and 4 located directly above. Images 12 - 13



Bowing to the water damaged plasterboard ceiling was noted. Image 14



Water staining was sighted to the concrete deep edge beam corresponding with the Entry wall. Image 15



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, nail popping to the ceiling lining due to movement within the timber framing and poor joint setting due to workmanship was noted.



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the observed water damage to the plasterboard ceiling and wall linings and cornice is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite.  



Stairwell lower



Swelling to the MDF staircase was observed, resulting in delamination to the floor tiles. Images 16 - 18



Water staining was noted to the wall lining. Image 19



We note the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report states the condition of the stairs is fair and there is no reference of damage.



In our opinion, the observed water damage to the staircase is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite.  



Dining room 



Minor water staining to the wall about the timber balustrade was noted. Images 20 - 21



Water staining to the floor tiles was observed. Image 22



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, evidence of lateral damp was noted to the Dining room internal walls, indicating cavity bridge, plumbing leak or an undetected leak.



Additionally, the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report references evidence of falling damp to the Dining room internal walls, indicating defective roofing, roof flashings or faulty waterproofing membrane. 



In our opinion, the evidence of pre-existing damp to the wall linings, indicates pre-existing moisture issues within the subject property. 



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the observed water damage to the plasterboard wall lining and floor tiles is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite.  



Kitchen



Swelling was observed to the kitchen cabinetry end panels, back bar, kickboards and two (2) door fronts. Images 23 - 26



Cracking was observed to several floor tiles adjacent to the swollen kitchen cabinetry, consistent with swelling to the particleboard flooring. Image 27



Elevated moisture levels were noted to the cabinetry and flooring. Images 28 - 29



We note the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report states the condition of the kitchen fixtures is generally fair. 



Additionally, the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report notes the condition of floor tiles are generally acceptable and no reference of damage is noted. 



In our opinion, the observed water damage to the cabinetry and floor tiles is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite.  



Stairwell upper



Swelling to the MDF staircase was observed, resulting in delamination to the floor tiles. Images 30 - 31



We note the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report states the condition of the stairs is fair and there is no reference of damage.



In our opinion, the observed water damage to the staircase is consistent with water damage from the burst flexi hose to the Ensuite.  



Ensuite



Swelling and water staining was observed to the vanity. Images 32 - 33



An inspection opening to the rear of the vanity and corresponding fibre cement wall lining was noted. Image 34



No evidence of water damage was observed to the cavity behind the vanity. Image 35



Water staining to the door jamb and architrave was sighted. Image 36



Elevated moisture levels to the bifold doors and door jamb was evident. Images 37 - 38



We note the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report states the shower recess was tested and failed, indicating failure to the waterproofing membrane or a plumbing leak.



Additionally, high moisture levels in the range of 14 - 40% were detected to the Ensuite walls which is considered higher than acceptable and indicative of a water leak or possible timber pest activity. 



In our opinion, evidence of the failed shower recess test and high moisture levels to the wall linings indicate pre-existing moisture issues within the subject property. 



Notwithstanding the above information, we note the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report advises the condition of the vanity is generally acceptable.  



On that basis, in our opinion, at the time of the First Visual Property Inspection Report, evidence of a burst flexihose was not present and the escape of liquids occurred subsequent to the inspection. 



We note the vanity and door jamb and architrave has been installed onto the floor substrate and advise the removal will inevitably compromise the waterproofing membrane.



Given the above, we recommend a complete removal and reinstatement of the Ensuite is required to provide a warrantable repair in accordance with Australian Standard AS 3740:2021 Waterproofing of domestic areas.



Bedroom 1



Heavy saturation and water staining was present to the carpet. Images 39 - 41 



From inspection of the particleboard flooring from the Living room below, we observed heavy saturation, swelling and mould growth to the floor substrate. Image 42



In our opinion, the structural integrity of the flooring substrate has been compromised and requires replacement. 



Furthermore, extensive mould growth was observed to the floor cavity and corresponding flooring members. Image 43



In our opinion, the observed damage to the particleboard and presence of extensive mould growth is consistent with water pooling on the flooring substrate for an extended period of time. 



Water staining was observed to the robe wall linings. Image 44



Elevated moisture levels up to 85% were detected to the plasterboard wall linings. Image 45



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report there is no reference of damage to the bedroom.



In our opinion, the observed water damage to the carpet, flooring and wall linings is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexi hose to the Ensuite.  

 

Bedroom 2



Heavy saturation and water staining was present to the carpet. Images 46 - 47



Elevated moisture levels up to 91% were detected to the plasterboard wall linings. Image 48



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, high moisture levels in the range of 14 - 40% were detected to Bedroom 2 walls which is considered higher than acceptable and indicative of a water leak or possible timber pest activity. 



Additionally, the report states evidence of lateral damp was noted to Bedroom 2 internal walls, indicating cavity bridge, plumbing leak or an undetected leak.



Furthermore, the report notes evidence of falling damp to Bedroom 2 internal walls, indicating defective roofing, roof flashings or faulty waterproofing membrane. 



In our opinion, evidence of pre-existing damp the wall linings, indicates pre-existing moisture issues within the subject property. 



Given the above, the evidence of elevated moisture levels and pre-existing damp to the wall linings indicates pre-existing moisture issues within the subject property. 



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the observed water damage to the carpet and elevated moisture levels to the plasterboard wall lining is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite.  



Bedroom 3



Heavy saturation and water staining was present to the carpet. Images 49 - 50



Bubbling paint to the plasterboard wall lining within the robe was observed. Image 51



Elevated moisture levels up to 89% were detected to the plasterboard wall linings. Image 52



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report there is no reference of damage to the bedroom.



In our opinion, the observed water damage to the carpet and plasterboard wall lining is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite.  



Bedroom 4



Heavy saturation and water staining was present to the carpet. Images 53 - 54



Elevated moisture levels up to 46% were detected to the plasterboard wall linings. Image 55

From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, evidence of lateral damp was noted to Bedroom 4 internal walls, indicating cavity bridge, plumbing leak or an undetected leak.



Additionally, the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report notes evidence of falling damp to Bedroom 4 internal walls, indicating defective roofing, roof flashings or faulty waterproofing membrane. 



In our opinion, evidence of pre-existing damp the wall linings, indicates pre-existing moisture issues within the subject property.



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the observed water damage to the carpet and elevated moisture levels to the plasterboard wall lining is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexi hose to the Ensuite.  



Hallway



Undulation to the floor tiles was observed about Bedroom 1 and 2 doorways, consistent with swelling to the particleboard flooring. Images 56 - 57 



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, high moisture levels in the range of 14-40% were detected to the Hallway walls which is considered higher than acceptable and indicative of a water leak or possible timber pest activity. 



Additionally, the report states evidence of lateral damp was noted to the Hallway internal walls, indicating cavity bridge, plumbing leak or an undetected leak.



Furthermore, the report notes evidence of falling damp to the Hallway internal walls, indicating defective roofing, roof flashings or faulty waterproofing membrane. 



Given the above, evidence of pre-existing damp the wall linings, indicates pre-existing moisture issues within the subject property.



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the observed water damage to the flooring substrate is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite. 

External Damage

Porch



Water staining, mould growth and swelling was observed to the soffit lining located directly below Bedroom 1 and 2. Images 58 - 59

Evidence of water runoff was visible to the masonry wall directly below the soffit lining. Image 60



From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report there is no reference of damage to the Porch. 



In our opinion, the observed water damage to the soffit lining is consistent with water damage resulting from the burst flexihose to the Ensuite.  





From review of the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, we note several areas throughout the subject property require maintenance and repair which is not consistent with the observed water damage relating to the claimed escape of liquid. 



On that basis, comment on these items has not been made.","Review of Insureds Provided Documentation 

From the Insured provided information, we note the following findings:



Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, dated 12 September 2022



The overall condition of the inspected areas in the context of age, type and general expectations of similar properties is average, with areas of the building requiring repair or maintenance. 



No major defects were identified. 



Minor defects were observed which are consistent with the average condition of similar buildings of approximately the same age that have been reasonably maintained.



High moisture levels in the range of 20 - 22% were detected to the Garage masonry walls, which is considered higher than acceptable and indicative of a water leak or possible timber pest activity. 



High moisture levels in the range of 14 - 40% were detected to the Bathroom, Ensuite, Bedroom 2 and Hallway, which is considered higher than acceptable and indicative of a water leak or possible timber pest activity. 



Evidence of lateral damp was noted to the Bathroom, Ensuite, Laundry, Kitchen, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 4, Dining room, Family room, Entry, Hallway and Stairwell. 



Falling damp noted consistent with defective roofing, roof flashings or faulty waterproofing membrane was noted to the Bathroom, Ensuite, Laundry, Kitchen, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 4, Dining room, Family room, Entry, Hallway and Stairwell.



Failed shower recess test to the Bathroom and Ensuite showers, consistent with failed waterproofing membrane or plumbing leak. 



Evidence of previous water penetration through the ceiling lining to the Bathroom, Ensuite, Kitchen, Bedroom 2 and Bedroom 3, consistent with a roof leak.



No evidence of water damage relating to the claimed burst flexihose was noted to the subject property. 





ZIGZ Plumbing Solutions Tax Invoice 2241, dated 28 November 2022 (Appendix A)



Leak detection was carried out to the subject property and a burst cold water flexihose to the Ensuite vanity was identified.



A loose kinko nut and olive connection to rear of vanity was noted.



Imagery verifying the aforementioned burst flexihose and replacement to the Ensuite vanity. 





We note we are not privy to the leak detection report and on that basis, we recommend a comprehensive leak detection test is carried out by a suitably qualified Plumber to identify any further leaks as referenced in the Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report. 



Given the above, in our opinion, there is evidence of significant pre-existing moisture issues throughout the property predating the claimed escape of liquid event. 



Although no reference to water damage was remarked in the First Visual Property Inspection Report, given the elevated moisture levels, we envisage there is long-term concealed damage to the subject property behind the building fabric not relating to the escape of liquid.

Assessment of Causation 

From review of the provided Inspect it First Visual Property Inspection Report, elevated moisture levels up to 40% were detected to internal walls to the Bathroom, Ensuite, Bedroom 2 and Hallway with no evidence of water damage to these areas. 

At the time of our inspection, we noted excessively high moisture levels up to 91% to Bedroom 1, 2, 3, 4 and the Hallway, with resultant damage. 



These elevated moisture level indicate saturation to the building substrates and is consistent with the escape of liquid from the Ensuite vanity flexihose.  



In our opinion, the subject property has experienced the escape of liquid from the Ensuite vanity flexihose subsequent to the property inspection in September 2022. 



We opine, given the extent of the observed water damage, water has escaped from the burst flexihose over a period of time when the property was not occupied and pooled on the upper level of the subject property, permeating through the flooring substrate and tracking down the stair case to the lower levels, resulting in water damage to all levels of the subject property.","From our inspection and assessment, we provide the following table which summarises the claimed damages and their proximate causation.

"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property to which the following fire damage was noted:

External Damage 



Asbestos Eaves Lining 



We noted soot staining to the eaves lining at the number of locations requiring removal and replacement which include the following areas:



Western external; Image 2

Eastern elevation; Images 3

Southern elevation; Image 4

Northern elevation. Image 5



Given smoke has entered the ceiling cavity, we have allowed for the complete removal and replacement of all eaves lining.



From its general appearance and based on the age of the building, the eaves lining has been identified as possible asbestos containing material (ACM) and as such will have to be removed and disposed of by a suitably licensed professional under the Fair-Trading Act and in line with the SafeWork NSW requirements for the handling and disposal of Asbestos related products.  



All asbestos-related products and as such have to be removed and disposed of by a properly licensed person under the Fair-Trading Act and in line with the SafeWork NSW requirements for the handling and disposal of Asbestos related products.











Weatherboard Cladding



Soot staining from the fire was noted on the external weatherboard cladding. 



As such, the removal and replacement of the damaged weatherboard cladding at the following locations has been included in our Scope of Works:



Western elevation; Image 6

Northern elevation. Image 7

Southern elevation. Image 8



We noted weatherboard cladding about the western elevation had become detached, which is consistent with long-term deterioration of fixings, unrelated to the subject Fire event. Image 9



Rear Patio



Damage to the polycarbonate roof sheeting of the rear patio was noted consistent with heat exposure from the fire event. Image 10.



Comparatively to the above, the timber decking boards and awning framework have been affected by soot staining which is superficial in nature and has not affected the structural integrity. Image 11



As such, we have allowed for the sanding and recoating of the decking, and for the application of bleed seal and paint to the patio roof framework.



Subfloor



From inspection of the sub-floor area we noted extensive soot staining to the timber framework. Images 12 – 13 



However, we did not observe any charring to the framework from our localised inspection, to which the structural integrity of the floor framework has evidently not been compromised by the subject fire event.



As such, have allowed for application of Zinsser to the entire floor framework within our Scope of Works.



Internal Fire Damage

Flooring



The timber floating floorboards within the entire dwelling require removal and replacement due to significant soot and fire damage. Images 14 – 19



We have also allowed for the replacement of the particleboard floor sheeting which has also evidently been compromised by the subject fire event. 



Furthermore, the floor tiles in the bathroom and laundry will also require removal and replacement. Images 20 – 21



Plasterboard Walls and Ceiling Linings



We noted extensive fire and soot damage to all wall and ceiling linings throughout the entire property. Images 22 – 29



As such, we confirm that all wall and ceiling linings throughout the entire property will require removal and replacement which has been included within our Scope of Works.



Furthermore, as a result of the replacement of the ceiling and wall linings, we confirm that skirtings, architraves and cornices also require removal and replacement throughout the entire property.



Windows and Doors



We confirm that all doors and windows throughout the entire property have been affected by heat and soot damage inclusive of associated flyscreens, requiring removal and replacement throughout. Images 30 – 37



Kitchen



We noted fire damage to the kitchen cabinetry, fixtures, benchtop, rangehood, oven, stove and sink requiring removal and replacement. Images 38 – 40



Bathroom



We confirm that the subject fire event has compromised the waterproofing within the bathroom and caused damage to the wall tiles and fixtures throughout. Images 41 – 42



As such, the entire bathroom will need to be stripped to allow for waterproofing replacement and all fixtures and fittings will also require replacement. 



Laundry



We confirm that the Laundry fixtures have been fire affected and require removal and replacement which has been included within our Scope of Works. Image 43



Built-in Wardrobes



We confirm that the built-in wardrobes within the Bedrooms have been fire affected and require removal and replacement which has been included within our Scope of Works. Images 44 – 46



Electrical



We confirm that all electrical wiring, fittings and fixtures have been heat affected and required removal and replacement throughout the entire property which has been included within our Scope of Works.



Air-Conditioning



We note that the Air-Conditioning unit within the Lounge Room has been fire affected and required removal and replacement. Image 47



Ceiling Cavity and Roof Framework



From inspection of the roof cavity, we noted minor soot staining to the timber roof framework, sarking and to the ceiling insulation. Images 48 – 49



From our inspection of the roof cavity we did not note any charring to indicate the roof framework had been compromised.



As such, all framework in the roof cavity is required to be cleaned and have an application of Zinsser. 



Notwithstanding the above, all insulation will require removal and replacement.







Wall Framework



Due to the wall linings covering the wall framework we were unable to observe if there is any damage to the framework.



Once wall linings have been removed assessment of the wall framework is able to be undertaken. 



However, at this stage it is evident that damage to the wall framework is minimal given the plasterboard wall lining has not been completely destroyed.",NA,"Subsequent to our inspection of the subject fire damaged property, we confirm the following building fabrics and elements have sustained fire and smoke damage beyond repair, requiring removal and replacement.

Extent of Fire Damage

Internal – Images 2 – 22 & 28 – 31



All ceiling, wall and floor linings within Bedroom 1 and within the adjacent Ensuite have been destroyed by the fire. 


Similarly, wall, ceiling and roof framework within the abovementioned has been charred and damaged by the fire, requiring localised removal and replacement. 



The entire insulation batts within the ceiling and wall cavities require removal and replacement due to smoke damage and odour. 



All ducting within the ceiling cavity has been affected and damaged by the fire and will require removal and replacement. 



The remaining wall and ceiling linings have sustained significant fire and smoke damage beyond repairable. 



Fire and smoke have entered the ceiling cavity causing smoke staining to roof, ceiling and wall framework outside of Bedroom 1, however, only require cleaning and sanitising followed by bleed seal. 



Fire and smoke observed to carpet floor lining, whereas smoke damage and localised cracking noted to the floor tiles. 



The abovementioned items shall require removal and replacement entirely to ensure a warrantable repair. 



All doors, windows inclusive of architraves and other fit-outs have also sustained significant fire and smoke damage, requiring removal and replacement. 



All services within the property have either been affected or destroyed by the fire and will require removal and replacement. 



In essence, we advise that the interior of the property requires to be stripped out completely as a result of the fire event.   



External – Images 23 – 27



From our observations, only the roof tiles above Bedroom 1 will require removal and replacement due to fire entering the ceiling cavity causing significant fire and smoke damage. 


Eaves lining all around Bedroom 1 as well as soffit linings about the front Porch require removal and replacement due to fire and smoke damage. 



Downpipe and eaves gutter about the abovementioned location shall also require removal and replacement as a result of fire damage. 



The brick veneer only sustained smoke staining on the internal face which can be removal through cleaning and sanitising followed by bleed seal.   



We advise that external damage occurred in lesser degree of severity compared to the observed internal fire damage.",NA,"Resultant Fire Damage  

Subject to our inspection, as detailed in the body of this report, we confirm the observed fire and smoke damage sustained throughout the property is a result of the fire event, which initiated from within Bedroom 1. 



We advise that the fire and smoke damaged elements are beyond repair, requiring removal and replacement.  



As such, the interior of the property shall require complete strip-out whilst localised repair to be undertaken to the exterior."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property to which the following was noted:

Assessment of Foundation Reactivity & General Building Movement

In prefacing the assessment of the observed damage, we refer to AS 2870:2011 – Residential Slabs and Footings which acknowledges that foundation movement and reactivity naturally occurs on nearly all sites and that it is impracticable to design a footing system that will protect the building from movement under all circumstances.



We refer to the CSIRO publication, BTF 18 – Foundation Maintenance and Footing Performance: A Homeowner’s Guide, which clearly indicates that buildings can and often move as a result of one or more issues in the foundation soil, namely relating to differential settlement, erosion, saturation, seasonal wetting and drying. 



A copy of this CSIRO publication is attached as Appendix A of this report. 



In saying this, general foundation reactivity and ground movement occurs as a result of the moisture content alteration within the foundation material, which shrinks upon drying and swells upon wetting over multiple courses of rainfall, causing heaving and shifting within the footings gradually and progressively over an extended period of time.



On the basis of the above, given the age and construction of the property, on-going and cyclic foundation reactivity and ground movement is always expected to occur, to which building movement and cracking is ultimately expected over time.  

Assessment of Observed Damage

Location 1 – Movement to External Pavers



Along the northern external pathway, we noted localised areas of movement to the floor pavers, to which localised foundation subsidence was evident. Images 2 – 4



In our opinion, if such movement had occurred as a result of the claimed storm event, a more widespread and consistent area of movement would have been observed.



In ascertaining the cause of damage, we note that the pavers are laid directly on natural ground.



In saying this, the pavers are inherently susceptible to differential movement as a result of inadequate compaction at the time of construction, in combination with cyclic foot traffic over an extended period of time.



We further noted evidence of vegetation growth between paver gaps which is indicative of such movement being a long-term issue.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed movement to the pavers is attributable to inherent construction issues and deterioration over an extended period of time and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 2A – Cracking to Northern External Wall



We noted vertical cracking to the northern external masonry wall, propagating from the Main Bedroom window opening. Images 5 & 6



From our inspection, we noted no evidence of vertical articulation joint provisions throughout the external walls of the property.



In accordance with NCC BCA 2019 and AS 4773.2:2015 – Masonry in small buildings - Construction, articulation joints are to be used in masonry construction to reduce cracking or distress of masonry caused by contraction or expansion of the masonry units, or by footing movement or other structural movement.



In particular, vertical articulation joints must be provided in straight, continuous walls with openings more than 900 x 900 mm — at not more than 5 m centres and located so that they are not more than 1.2 m away from openings.



An excerpt taken from AS 3700:2018, highlighting the full articulation joint requirements has been provided in Appendix B.



Given that the window opening measures approximately 2.4m x 1.3m, the pattern and mechanism of the observed cracks appear to be consistent with the omission of vertical articulation joints, in accordance with the above requirements, in accommodating long-term building and foundation movement.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.







Location 2B – Cracking to Floor Tiles within Rear Porch



Adjacent to the abovementioned damage, we noted hairline cracking across the floor tiles within the Rear Porch. Images 7 & 8



We noted no differential movement of the slab on either side of the crack, which would be expected in the case of foundation subsidence. 



In view of the above, in our opinion, such cracking is consistent with the shrinkage of the concrete slab substrate which occurs within concrete as a result of an uncontrolled and inadequate curing process after pouring.  



In saying this, the plastic shrinkage of the substrate has induced cracking within the overlying floor tiles.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 3 – Cracking to Southern External Wall



Along the southern external masonry wall, we noted cracking which appeared mostly vertical in nature. Images 9 & 10



On the opposing internal side of the wall, we noted no evidence of corresponding cracking to suggest that foundation subsidence has occurred.



As previously discussed, we noted no evidence of vertical articulation joint provisions throughout the property, which are to be used in masonry construction to reduce cracking or distress of masonry caused by contraction or expansion of the masonry units, or by footing movement or other structural movement.



In particular, vertical articulation joints must be provided in unreinforced masonry walls greater than 5m in length.



Given that the southern wall alignment spans approximately 7.5m, the pattern and mechanism of the observed cracks appear to be consistent with the omission of vertical articulation joints, in accordance with the above requirements, in accommodating long-term building and foundation movement.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 4 – Cracking at South-Eastern External Wall Junction 



Further along the Southern Wall, we noted vertical cracking at the south-eastern corner junction with the abutting blade wall. Images 11 & 12



As previously discussed, in our opinion, the cracking appears to be consistent with the omission of necessary vertical articulation joint requirements within masonry veneer construction.



In particular, in accordance with AS 4773.2:2015, articulation joints are required where walls change in thickness.



In this case, in our opinion, the inherent perpendicular thermal movement of the abutting walls has induced cracking along the wall junction, in absence of articulation joint provisions.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 5 – Water Damage within Laundry



Within the Laundry, we noted blistering paint on the ceiling, adjacent cornices and top of the wall, about the south-western corner. Image 13



In ascertaining the cause of damage, we undertook an aerial drone inspection of the roof directly above.



From our observations, we noted evidence of gaps within the mortar bedding of the western gable end ridge tiles. Images 14 & 15



Given that the location of damage is directly at the downslope end of the gable, in our opinion, such damage is consistent with rainwater seeping into the mortar bedding gaps and tracking down the roof slope over time. 



In our opinion, given the considerable age of the property, such gaps are consistent with long-term deterioration of the bedding in absence of any maintenance, rather than being storm-created openings.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed water damage is attributable to long-term deterioration and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.







Location 6 – Cracking at Wall Corner within Main Bedroom



Within the Main Bedroom, we noted hairline vertical cracking at the south-eastern wall corner. Image 16



We noted the crack to be aged in appearance, with evidence of debris build-up within, which suggests that it is pre-existing in origin. Image 17



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the vertical pattern of cracking is consistent with inherent long-term thermal movement within the abutting plasterboard wall linings, which is an area of high stress concentration.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to long-term general building movement and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 7 – Cracking at Wall Corner within Main Bathroom



Within the Main Bathroom, we noted hairline vertical cracking at the south-eastern wall corner. Images 18 & 19



Similar to the above, in or opinion, such damage is attributable to inherent long-term thermal movement within the abutting plasterboard wall linings, which is an area of high stress concentration.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to long-term general building movement and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 8 – Cracking along Slab Edge at Garage Door Threshold



We noted cracking and spalling within the concrete threshold at the Garage door opening. Images 20 & 21



However, we noted no evidence of cracking, distress or movement to the adjacent masonry wall to suggest that any foundation subsidence has occurred from the claimed storm event.



At the location of damage, we noted differing colours within the concrete on each side of the crack, which is indicative of a previous patch repair.



In saying this, in our opinion, a cementitious repair mortar had been retrospectively applied at the slab edge in facilitating a smooth finish, and has delaminated from the original slab over time.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 9 – Cracking along Slab Edge at Entry Door Threshold



We noted cracking within the tiled threshold at the Entry door opening. Images 22 & 23



However, we noted no evidence of cracking, distress or movement to the adjacent masonry wall to suggest that any foundation subsidence has occurred from the claimed storm event.



In our opinion, such damage is consistent with the delamination of the cementitious repair mortar at the slab edge, which has induced cracking within the overlying tiles.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 10 – Cracking along Perimeter Mortar Joints at Entry Porch



Within the Entry Porch, we noted cracking along the mortar joints between the floor tiles and abutting external masonry walls. Images 24 & 25



We noted the floor tiles had been installed directly against the masonry walls with no movement joint provisions.



In accordance with AS 3958.1:2007 – Ceramic tiles - Guide to the installation of ceramic tiles, where floor tiles abut restraining surfaces such as perimeter walls, movement joints must be provided.



An excerpt from the abovementioned Australian Standard has been provided within Appendix C.



In absence of such requirements, in our opinion, cracking has been induced along the perimeter mortar joints as a result of the inherent differential thermal movement between the differing building materials.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Location 11 – Cracking to Ceiling within Lounge/Dining



Within the Loung/Dining room, we noted cracking to the plasterboard ceiling lining, propagating along the butt joint of two adjacent sheets about the internal wall corner. Image 26



With reference to the USG Boral Plasterboard Installation Manual 2016, expansion (control) joints should be installed at changes in direction within the plasterboard sheet layout to accommodate for movement or alterations in ambient conditions. (Refer to Appendix D). 



In absence of such control joint provisions, differential thermal movement between the plasterboard sheets has induced cracking along the weak planes over time.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.

 

Location 12 – Cracking on Eastern External Blade Wall



Along the eastern external masonry blade wall, we noted hairline horizontal cracking, propagating from the edge. Image 27



We further noted vertical cracking about the top of the wall on each side. Images 28 & 29



In close proximity to the observed damage, we noted the presence of a large timber pitching beam supported on the wall which has exhibited lateral movement, evidenced by visible paint lines. Image 30



In saying this, in our opinion, the cracking to the masonry wall is attributable to the long-term inherent differential thermal movement between the adjoining timber and masonry elements, which has induced stress onto the brittle brickwork and has ultimately resulted in cracking.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed cracking is attributable to inherent construction issues and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.

Assessment of Damage Category

In categorising the observed cracking damage, we refer to AS 2870:2011 – Residential Slabs and Footings - Table C1, which outlines the classification of damage to walls. Table 1 



Table 1 – Classification of Damage with Reference to Walls, taken from AS 2870



On the basis of the above, from our inspection, we noted no evidence of cracking greater than Damage Category 2, which describes cracks as noticeable but easily filled.



In saying this, in our opinion, the observed cracking damage is superficial in nature and is not demeaning to the structural integrity of the property.",NA,"Assessment of Foundation Reactivity & General Building Movement

In prefacing the assessment of the observed damage, we refer to AS 2870 – Residential Slabs and Footings which acknowledges that foundation movement and reactivity naturally occurs on nearly all sites and that it is impracticable to design a footing system that will protect the building from movement under all circumstances.



In accordance with CSIRO publication, BTF 18 – Foundation Maintenance and Footing Performance: A Homeowner’s Guide, buildings can and often move as a result of one or more issues in the foundation soil, namely relating to differential settlement, erosion, saturation, seasonal wetting and drying. 



On the basis of the above, given the age and construction of the property, on-going and cyclic foundation reactivity and ground movement is always expected to occur, to which building movement and cracking is ultimately expected over time.

To this end, in our opinion, the observed damage throughout the property is attributable to a combination of inherent construction issues and long-term deterioration, and is unrelated to the claimed storm or any other single insurable event.



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the observed cracking damage is superficial in nature and is not demeaning to the structural integrity of the property."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following damage was noted:

Entry

We noted cracking along the cornice and wall lining junction corresponding to the top corner of the entry door and the entry hallway. Images 2 - 6



We noted cracking to the wall linings propagating along the junction of intersecting walls within the entry hallway. Image 7



From our inspection and our structural assessment, in our opinion, the above-noted damage is cosmetic and consistent with inherent and general building movement and ongoing foundation reactivity.



Ground Front Bedroom – Northeast Alignment

We noted cracking and a gap between the cornice and wardrobe corresponding to the front bedroom about the northeast alignment of the subject building. Image 8



From our inspection and our structural assessment, in our opinion, the above-noted damage is cosmetic and consistent with inherent and general building movement and ongoing foundation reactivity.



Ground Front Bedroom – Northwest Alignment

Cracking Along Cornice and Wall Lining Junction



We noted cracking and a gap between the cornice and wall lining corresponding to the front bedroom about the northwest alignment of the subject building. Images 9 & 10



From our inspection and our structural assessment, in our opinion, the above-noted damage is cosmetic and consistent with inherent and general building movement and ongoing foundation reactivity.



Deflection and Undulation of Ceiling Lining



Moreover, we noted evidence of deflection and undulation to the ceiling lining within the subject bedroom. Image 11



The observed deflection within the ceiling lining, in our opinion, is consistent with the relaxation of the fixings/adhesive and detachment from the supportive ceiling framework.  



In our opinion, the bond and grip between the fixings/ adhesive of the ceiling lining into the supportive ceiling framework has been compromised over an extended period of time due to general wear and tear, which has ultimately resulted in the exhibited sagging and deflection. 



Kitchen/Dining

Cracking to Wall Linings



Moreover, we sighted vertical cracking propagating from the top corner of the door opening between the entry hallway and kitchen/ dining area. Images 12 & 13



In our opinion, the pattern and mechanism of exhibited damage are consistent with the following factors:



Inherent differential thermal movement (the expansion and contraction within the internal fabrics, which can arise from changes in environmental temperatures) between the wall lining and the underlying timber framework, inducing cracking about the points of high-stress concentrations (in particular, corner of openings, changes in direction, intersection of distinct materials and wall corner junction of perpendicular intersecting walls and etc).



Defective installation of plasterboard sheeting about the door opening in accordance with Australian Standard AS 2589:2017 - Gypsum linings - Application and finishing.



Australian Standard AS 2589, states:



“To avoid cracking of vertical joints at openings such as windows and doorways, vertical joints shall not coincide with the edge of openings and the sheets shall be laid so that the vertical joints fall a minimum of 200 mm from the edge of the opening”



In particular, the plasterboard sheet joints are to be at 200mm minimum from the edge of the opening as shown in Appendix A, a schematic diagram extracted from the USG Boral Plasterboard Installation Manual in line with the aforesaid Australian Standard requirements. 



As such, in our opinion, the noted cracking is cosmetic damage as a result of inherent building defect relative to the defective installation of plasterboard wall lining, which can result in cracking to propagate about the high-stress points due to inherent movement caused by differential thermal expansion/ contraction within the wall lining and the underlying framework.



Similar to the above, we noted vertical cracking to the wall lining immediately adjacent to the aforesaid door opening, which is also consistent with superficial damage due to the inherent differential thermal movement. Image 14



Further to the above, we noted cracking along the cornice and cracking along the wall lining above the kitchen cabinets adjacent to the existing timber beam supporting the upper flooring. Image 15

 

In our opinion, such damage is cosmetic and consistent with inherent and general building movement and ongoing foundation reactivity.





Protruding Nail Fixings Within Ceiling Lining



Furthermore, we noted evidence of protruding nail fixings within the ceiling lining corresponding to the kitchen/ dining area. Image 16



In our opinion, the observed damage is consistent with the long-term relaxation of fixings and detachment from the supportive ceiling framework.



Stair Landing

Cracking to Walls and Ceiling Linings



We noted vertical cracking propagating from the top corner of the door opening between the bedroom and the stair landing area. Images 17 & 18



As previously mentioned, the pattern and mechanism of damage are consistent with cosmetic damage due to the following factors:



Inherent differential thermal movement (the expansion and contraction within the internal fabrics, which can arise from changes in environmental temperatures) between the wall lining and the underlying timber framework, inducing cracking about the points of high-stress concentrations (in particular, corner of openings, changes in direction, intersection of distinct materials and wall corner junction of perpendicular intersecting walls and etc).



Defective installation of plasterboard sheeting about the door opening in accordance with Australian Standard AS 2589:2017 - Gypsum linings - Application and finishing.



Subsequently, in our opinion, the noted cracking is cosmetic damage as a result of inherent building defect relative to the defective installation of plasterboard wall lining, which can result in cracking to propagate about the high-stress points due to inherent movement caused by differential thermal expansion/ contraction within the wall lining and the underlying framework.



Moreover, we noted cracking to the cornice mitre joint and vertical cracking to the intersection of wall linings local to the corner of the stair landing area. Images 19 & 20



In our opinion, such damage is cosmetic and consistent with inherent and general building movement and ongoing foundation reactivity.



Furthermore, we noted cracking to the ceiling/ wall linings local to the corners of the void above the stairs. Images 21 - 23



In our opinion, such damage is consistent with inherent building movement and/ or differential thermal movement within the lining and the supporting framework, resulting in the observed cracking about the high-stress concentration point. 



We reiterate that the high-stress points are generally developed where there is a change in direction (corners, wall to ceiling junction, etc.) due to movement within the substrate/underlying structure or temperature and humidity fluctuation in the lining.



We also noted evidence of the previous patching and repairing works to the above-noted cracks, which is an indication of the ongoing issue.





Protruding Nail Fixings Within the Plasterboard Wall Lining



In addition, we noted protruding nail fixings within the plasterboard wall lining corresponding to the stair landing area. Images 24 & 25 



Such damage is superficial and consistent with the relaxation of nail fixing from the supporting timber studs due to the poor installation of nails at the time of construction, which over time, can result in nail fixings becoming loose and breaking through the plasterboard sheets over time.









Ground Floor Side Bedroom

Cracking to Plasterboard Wall Lining



From our inspection, we noted cracking propagating along the intersection of wall linings local to the corner of the bedroom. Images 26 & 27



In addition, we noted horizontal cracking to the wall lining adjacent to the window opening. Image 28



In our opinion, such damage is cosmetic and consistent with inherent and general building movement and ongoing foundation reactivity.





Protruding Nail Fixings Within the Plasterboard Wall Lining



In addition, we noted protruding nail fixings about the base of the wall lining below the bedroom window. Image 29 



Such damage is superficial and consistent with the relaxation of nail fixing from the supporting timber studs due to the poor installation of nails at the time of construction, which over time, can result in nail fixings becoming loose and breaking through the plasterboard sheets over time.



Living Room

We noted cracking along the plasterboard wall lining and the exiting timber architrave adjacent to the stairs. Images 30 & 31



In our opinion, such damage is consistent with inherent building movement and/ or differential thermal movement within the lining and the supporting framework, resulting in the observed cracking about the high-stress concentration point. 



Upper Floor Bedroom

Cracking Within Plasterboard Wall Lining



We noted diagonal cracking propagating from the bottom corner of the window opening within the upper floor bedroom. Images 32 & 33



In our opinion, the noted cracking is consistent with inherent thermal movement inducing cracking about the high-stress concentration points (window opening).





Protruding Nail Fixing Within Ceiling Lining



We further noted evidence of protruding nail fixings within the ceiling lining. Image 34



In our opinion, the observed damage is consistent with the long-term relaxation of fixings and detachment from the supportive ceiling framework.","Assessment of Internal Cracking and Foundation Reactivity 

Assessment of Footing Movement and Foundation Reactivity



In prefacing the assessment of the experienced footing movement, we refer to Australian Standard AS 2870 – Residential Slabs and Footings which acknowledges that foundation movement and reactivity naturally occurs on nearly all sites and that it is impracticable to design a footing system that will protect the building from movement under all circumstances. 

We also refer to the CSIRO publication, BTF 18 – Foundation Maintenance and Footing Performance: A Homeowner’s Guide, which clearly indicates that buildings can and often do move because of one or more issues in the foundation soil, namely relating to differential settlement, erosion, saturation, seasonal wetting and drying. Appendix B.



In saying this, general foundation movement occurs as a result of gradual settlement of supporting soils following construction as well as changes in moisture content within the foundation material, which shrinks upon drying and swells upon wetting over multiple courses of rainfall, causing heaving and shifting within the footings gradually and progressively over an extended period of time.



On this basis, on-going differential settlement, cyclic foundation reactivity and ground movement is expected to occur at all sites to some extent, to which building movement and cracking is ultimately expected over time.



Further to the above, upon inspection of the subfloor area, we advise that the existing footing system is consisted of isolated brick piers constructed off brick footings. Images 35 & 36



In saying this, brick footing system is highly susceptible to movement compared to concrete footing system due to non-homogenic movement within the individual bricks.  





Assessment of External Drainage



We estimate that the construction of the subject property is predating the inception of National Construction Code - NCC BCA 2019.



Notwithstanding the above, we reference the NCC BCA and current Australian Standards to clarify and explain the mechanism of damage.



With regards to external drainage, Australian Standard AS2870 states that “surface drainage shall be designed and constructed to avoid water ponding against or near the footing”. Appendix C.



From our inspection, we noted that the existing external drainage provision to be inadequate to effectively intercept water away from the subject building and footing system.



From our inspection, we noted that the natural topography of the land is sloping towards the subject house and subfloor space.



In saying that, the subfloor is susceptible to a large volume of surface and subterranean water during periods of rainfall.



We advise that such inherent construction and inadequate external drainage system facilitates the migration of water into the subfloor area during general storms and rainfalls.





Assessment of Subfloor Drainage



From the review of the subfloor drainage, we noted the existing drainage provisions are inadequate to divert water away from the subfloor area. 



In accordance with NCC BCA 2019, the ground beneath suspended floors must be graded so that the area beneath the building is above the adjacent external finished ground level and surface water is prevented from ponding under the building.



Moreover, we noted evidence of building debris within the subfloor, which in our opinion, inhibit free drainage of entrapped water within the subfloor area.



We refer to NCC BCA 2019, which outlines the following with respect to subfloor drainage. Appendix C:



Drainage system must be installed under buildings and where site conditions exist that create a need for subsoil water to be diverted away from footings, basements, retaining walls etc. 



From our review of the subfloor construction, we noted insufficient drainage provision to ensure that the entrapped water is adequately diverted away from the subfloor area.





Assessment of the Additional Rainfall



We acknowledge that the record high rainfalls occasioning the area is consistent with the La Niña rainfall phenomena, in particular since 2020 till this current time in 2022.



Based on the above, the significant increase in rainfall within the past two (2) years and into 2022 has caused higher degree of fluctuation in foundation material moisture content, which resulted in more severe foundation reactivity and movement resulting in more prominent movement and damage within the building fabrics. 



In our opinion, we consider the increase in received rainfall from 2020 to current to be the dominant factor in contributing to building movement as claimed rather than any defined event.



In addition, we were unable to identify any sign of damage or movement to the internal building fabrics, consistent with damage due to the sudden and abrupt movement within the foundation and the footing system.



Moreover, from our inspection of the subfloor, no sign of short-term damage or subsidence to the supporting brick piers and walls was noted to indicate the integrity of the footing system and the supporting soil have been compromised due to the experienced storm event.



In our opinion, the observed damage is consistent with general building movement due to inherent foundation reactivity, which results in cracking within the internal linings about the points of high-stress concentrations (corners, change in direction, door and window openings etc).  



Considering the above, in our opinion, insufficient external and subfloor drainage has allowed water to permeate into the subfloor area, particularly during the recent La Niña period, and causing ongoing foundation reactivity which resulted in general building movement. 







To this end, in our opinion, the underlying cause of the observed cracking within the subject property is a result of inherent construction issues due to the lack of drainage provisions in combination with long-term foundation reactivity and movement, unrelated to a one-off event.","Observed Damage

Assessment of Internal Cracking and Foundation Reactivity 

Further to the above, as outlined in the body of this Report, in accordance with Australian Standard AS 2870 and CSIRO publication, foundation reactivity occurs on nearly all sites due to seasonal moisture fluctuation within the foundation soils and is almost impractical to design a footing system to prevent the building from undergoing movement. 



In addition to the above, given that Australia is going through the La Niña period, the increase in the received rainfalls within the past two (2) years and into 2022 further facilitates foundation reactivity within the subfloor area.   



In addition, we advise there is a lack of drainage provisions to intercept stormwater from entering the subfloor or divert the entrapped water away from the subfloor area. 



Considering the lack of drainage provisions, we consider the increase in received rainfall from 2020 to current to be the dominant factor in contributing to building movement as claimed rather than a defined event.



Considering the foregoing, in our opinion, the underlying cause of the observed internal cracking is a result of inherent construction issues due to lack of external and subfloor drainage which enables water to permeate into the subfloor and cause ongoing and long-term foundation reactivity, unrelated to a one-off event.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed damage is superficial in nature, which can be pathed and repaired, and the overall structural integrity of the subject dwelling has not been compromised."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property to which the following was noted:

Observed Damage

Within the internal areas of the dwelling, the Insured has claimed that the carpet flooring has been exhibiting ongoing dampness and mould. Images 2 – 4



Across the external masonry walls, we noted several locations of step-cracking along the brickwork mortar joint, lateral shifting and rotation of the brickwork, mainly propagating from wall corners and the corners of openings. Images 5 – 10

Assessment of Cracking to Brickwork

Foundation Reactivity & General Building Movement



In prefacing the assessment of the observed damage, we refer to AS 2870 – Residential Slabs and Footings which acknowledges that foundation movement and reactivity naturally occurs on nearly all sites and that it is impracticable to design a footing system that will protect the building from movement under all circumstances.



We refer to the CSIRO publication, BTF 18 – Foundation Maintenance and Footing Performance: A Homeowner’s Guide, which clearly indicates that buildings can and often move as a result of one or more issues in the foundation soil, namely relating to differential settlement, erosion, saturation, seasonal wetting and drying. 



A copy of this CSIRO publication is attached as Appendix A of this report. 



In saying this, general foundation reactivity and ground movement occurs as a result of the moisture content alteration within the foundation material, which shrinks upon drying and swells upon wetting over multiple courses of rainfall, causing heaving and shifting within the footings gradually and progressively over an extended period of time in years.



We note that the property is supported on timber floor bearers and joists which sit on perimeter brick dwarf walls and isolated brick piers.



In saying this, we advise that such aged foundation system is particularly susceptible to movement due to its non-homogenous configuration compared to tied systems such as a concrete raft slab.



On the basis of the above, given the age and construction of the property, on-going and cyclic foundation reactivity and ground movement is always expected to occur, to which building movement and cracking about locations of high stress concentrations is ultimately expected over time.  



Furthermore, we refer to Bureau of Metrology (BOM) website to review rainfall periods at the nearest weather station located at Moss Vale AWS (approximately 5.4km away) over the period of last six (6) years, from 2017 to 2022, in Figure 2 below:





Figure 2 – Historical Monthly Rainfalls from 2017 to 2022



From the above, we note that the recorded annual rainfalls in 2017, 2018 and 2019 are within 400mm to 660mm, whilst the recorded annual rainfalls in 2020 and 2021 are in excess of 920mm, which is nearly 50% greater.



The record high rainfalls over the last two (2) years are consistent with the La Niña weather phenomenon which occurs roughly every three to seven years, causing extreme rainfalls.



In saying this, Australia has been in a La Niña period from 2020 and currently into 2022, which follows a severe drought period from 2017 – 2019 in many parts of the country.



In saying this, the foundation materials within the subject site have experienced generally dry periods over 2017 – 2019, followed by excessively wet periods since 2020.



As such, the higher degree of fluctuation in foundation material moisture content over the last six (6) years has resulted in more severe foundation reactivity and movement resulting in more prominent movement and damage within the building fabrics.



On the above basis, we consider the increase in received rainfall from 2020 to current to be the dominant factor in contributing to building movement as claimed rather than any defined storm event.



In saying this, considering that the general foundation reactivity and ground movement is an ongoing mechanism, the observed cracking and movement will always be expected to reoccur.



Inadequate Subfloor Drainage



At the time of our inspection, we noted that the subfloor was significantly inundated. Images 11 & 12



Given that only light rainfall had occurred around the period of our inspection, the observed ponding water is indicative of inadequate subfloor drainage provisions.



In particular, we noted the subfloor to be relatively flat in grade, with evident divots which facilitate such water ponding.



Given the considerable age of the property, we envisage that its construction pre-dates the inception of the current National Construction Code Building Code of Australia 2019 (NCC BCA 2019) and Australian Standards, however, we only refer to such codes for explanatory purposes on the causation and mechanism of the observed damage.



In accordance with NCC BCA 2019, the ground beneath suspended floors must be graded so that the area beneath the building is above the adjacent external finished ground level and surface water is prevented from ponding under the building.



An illustrative diagram taken from NCC BCA 2019 has been provided in Figure 3.





Figure 3 – Grading of Ground Under Suspended Floors



We noted similar grading issues with the external surrounding soil, which is located higher than the subfloor ground level, to which the subfloor would be inherently susceptible to surface water ingress during rainfall over time.



On the basis of the above, in our opinion, water ingress is easily able to occur into the subfloor area during general rainfall over time and, in absence of adequate drainage provisions, contributes to the ongoing inherent foundation reactivity. 



Omission of Cavity Flashing and Weepholes



Moreover, we noted no evidence of visible weepholes or a cavity flashing along the external masonry walls. Images 13 & 14



We refer to AS 4773.2:2015 Masonry in small buildings – Construction, which outlines the following requirements for masonry veneer construction: 



Weepholes are required at 1200mm maximum centres at the base of the wall cavity, to enable the discharge of any contained moisture. 



Cavity flashings are required to extend the full width and be visible at the face of the wall including after rendering or any other applied coatings, to facilitate the full discharge of moisture out the face of the wall and mitigate the risk of possible backtrack along the underside.  



On the basis of the above, any entrapped moisture within the wall cavity is unable to effectively discharge out the face of the masonry veneer walls and rather, leads to the possibility of permeating through the internal linings or down into the subfloor. 



In saying this, we consider such construction issues to be a contributing factor to the experienced water ingress into subfloor, which in turn, exacerbates the ongoing inherent foundation reactivity. 



Inadequate Downpipe Connections



Further from our external inspection, we noted four (4) roof downpipes which are not connected to any stormwater lines. Images 15 – 18



In saying this, the downpipes discharge water directly into the surrounding soil during rainfall.



On the basis of the above, in our opinion, the excessive inundation of the soil in such areas exacerbates the moisture fluctuations within the soil over time, which contributes to the ongoing inherent foundation reactivity.



Tree Root Moisture Suction



Moreover, we noted the presence of a large tree directly adjacent to the eastern external wall of the dwelling where the brickwork has shifted and rotated. Image 19



As outlined within the CSIRO publication, we advise that tree roots inherently absorb subterranean moisture which results in drying out of the soil and removal of support from under footings by inducing shrinkage.



In saying this, in our opinion, such long-term tree root moisture suction would have exacerbated the inherent moisture fluctuations within the soil over time, contributing to the observed cracks to the masonry walls, to which the level of severity was observed to be greater around the subject area.



To this end, in our opinion, the underlying cause of water ingress within the subfloor and cracking to the brickwork is attributable to inherent construction issues and long-term foundation reactivity, and is unrelated to any single storm or other insurable event.

Assessment of Mould Damage to Carpet Flooring

Excessive Subfloor Moisture



As previously discussed, in absence of adequate subfloor drainage provisions, significant ponding of water occurs over time.



In saying this, the flooring would be exposed to high moisture conditions for prolonged periods, to which we envisage would facilitate mould growth across the carpet flooring as claimed by the Insured. 



Omission of Cavity Flashing and Weepholes



Furthermore, as previously discussed, we opine that the omission of cavity flashing and weepholes causes entrapped moisture within the wall cavity to permeate through into the internal areas rather than effectively discharging out the face of the masonry veneer walls.



In saying this, in our opinion, such long-term moisture permeation is a contributing factor to the experienced mould growth across the carpet flooring.



To this end, in our opinion, the underlying cause of mould growth to the internal carpet flooring is attributable to inherent construction issues, and is unrelated to any single storm or other insurable event.",NA,"Assessment of Cracking to Brickwork

In prefacing the assessment of the observed damage, we refer to AS 2870 – Residential Slabs and Footings which acknowledges that foundation movement and reactivity naturally occurs on nearly all sites and that it is impracticable to design a footing system that will protect the building from movement under all circumstances.



We refer to the CSIRO publication, BTF 18 – Foundation Maintenance and Footing Performance: A Homeowner’s Guide, which clearly indicates that buildings can and often move as a result of one or more issues in the foundation soil, namely relating to differential settlement, erosion, saturation, seasonal wetting and drying. 

Furthermore, the property is supported on timber floor bearers and joists which sit on perimeter brick dwarf walls and isolated brick piers. Which is particularly susceptible to movement due to its non-homogenous configuration compared to tied systems such as a concrete raft slab.



On the basis of the above, given the age and construction of the property, on-going and cyclic foundation reactivity and ground movement is always expected to occur, to which building movement and cracking about locations of high stress concentrations is ultimately expected over time.



Moreover, we advise that Australia has been in a La Niña period from 2020 and currently into 2022, which follows a severe drought period from 2017 – 2019 in many parts of the country.



As such, the higher degree of fluctuation in foundation material moisture content over the last six (6) years has resulted in more severe foundation reactivity and movement resulting in more prominent movement and damage within the building fabrics.



On the above basis, we consider the increase in received rainfall from 2020 to current to be the dominant factor in contributing to building movement as claimed rather than any defined storm event.



Further from our inspection, we consider the following issues to be contributing factors to the abovementioned ongoing inherent foundation reactivity and subsequent cracking to the external brickwork:



Inadequate subfloor and site surface drainage provisions, which results in inundation and ponding of water within subfloor, contributing to the ongoing foundation reactivity.



Omission of cavity flashing and weepholes across the external masonry walls, causing any entrapped moisture within the wall cavity to permeate down into the subfloor, rather than effectively discharge externally, contributing to the ongoing foundation reactivity.



Unconnected roof downpipes which discharge directly to the surrounding soil, exacerbating soil moisture fluctuations and contributing to the ongoing foundation reactivity



Long-term tree root growth and soil moisture suction, exacerbating moisture soil fluctuations and removal of support from footings by inducing shrinkage.



To this end, in our opinion, the underlying cause of water ingress within the subfloor and cracking to the brickwork is attributable to inherent construction issues and long-term foundation reactivity, and is unrelated to any single storm or other insurable event.



Assessment of Mould Damage to Carpet Flooring

From our inspection, we consider the following issues to be contributing factors to the experienced mould growth within the carpet flooring:



In absence of adequate subfloor drainage provisions, significant ponding of water occurs over time, to which the flooring would be exposed to high moisture conditions for prolonged periods, facilitating mould growth over time.



Omission of cavity flashing and weepholes across the external masonry walls, causing any entrapped moisture within the wall cavity to permeate into the internal areas, rather than effectively discharge externally, contributing to the mould growth.



To this end, in our opinion, the underlying cause of mould growth to the internal carpet flooring is attributable to inherent construction issues, and is unrelated to any single storm or other insurable event."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following observations was noted:



Swimming Pool Structure



The pool construction consists of metal sheets carcass and supporting uprights which has been lined with a plastic waterproof membrane and Styrofoam panels utilised as stairs. 



At time of inspection, the Styrofoam stairs were observed to have uplifted together with the polyurethane liners and separation of horizontal coping members at the butting joint. Images 4 -6

 

In our opinion, the construction of the pool is typical of a pre-fabricated “above ground” swimming pool system.



The embedment of the pool structure into the ground has resulted in “in-ground” application of the subject pool system contrary to the “above-ground” intended design and function.



In saying this, in contrast to “in-ground” pool systems, “above-ground” pool systems are not generally designed to withstand soil and hydrostatic pressures from the exterior of the pool and have been designed for containment of pool water pressure only.



In this case, the exerted earth and hydrostatic pressure onto the pool carcass associated with its construction in an “in-ground” system capacity is beyond the design function and intent of an “above ground” pool structure and its carcass. 



In illustrating the mechanism of failure, we have provided a schematic diagram of the earth pressure and hydrostatic pressures acting on the external face of the pool structure in Figure 2.







Figure 2 - Schematic Diagram of Resultant Internal & External Pressures Acting on the Pool Structure and Carcass Resulting in the Buckling and Damage as Observed.



On the above basis, the imbalance of the pressure between the earth pressure and the hydrostatic pressure from the water in the pool has ultimately exceeded equilibrium within the pool structure’s stability causing failure and buckling about section of the carcass and liners as experienced.



The loss of equilibrium between the resisting internal pressure and the applied external pressure has caused imbalance and ultimately the loss of the pool structure’s integrity. 



As such, saturation of the backfill material during the experienced storm together with hydrostatic build-up against the pool carcass has exceeded the design capacity of the pool structure resulting in the observed failure and buckling of the pool liner and uplift of the Styrofoam stairs.



In our opinion the movement of the carcass has allowed for the disengagement of the polyurethane membrane allowing water to enter below the Styrofoam staircase and cause the experienced uplift. 



In our opinion, the subject “above ground” pool system was not designed to be used for “in-ground” application. 



In addition, the use of the Styrofoam stairs is grossly inadequate and unsuitable as the density of Styrofoam is very low compared to water, making it buoyant during saturation of foundation material. 



In saying this, if the pool was correctly constructed as an in-ground pool using concrete wall or fibreglass in accordance with the manufacturer’s specification, the observed damage would not have occurred irrespective of the severity of the storm. 



On the above basis, the observed damage is unrelated to an insurable event and the failure can be solely contributed to the inadequacy of the pool construction constructed 11 months ago adopting above ground pool system for in ground application.",NA,"In our opinion, the cause of damage to the pool is attributable to the following circumstances and factors:



The current pool configuration is an “above ground” system which has been installed as an “in ground” swimming pool.



An “above-ground” pool system is designed for the containment of internal pool water pressure only, whilst “in-ground” pool systems are designed to withstand both internal water pressure and soil and hydrostatic pressures from the exterior of the pool.



High saturation of surrounding fill by high rainfall activity during the storm event and hydrostatic pressure build up.



In combination with the above-mentioned factors, the imbalance of the pressure between the earth pressure and the hydrostatic pressure from the water in the pool has ultimately exceeded equilibrium within the pool structure’s stability causing failure and buckling about section of the carcass and liners as experienced.



The loss of equilibrium between the resisting internal pressure and the applied external pressure has caused imbalance and ultimately the loss of the pool structure’s integrity. 



As such, saturation of the backfill material during the experienced storm together with hydrostatic build-up against the pool carcass has exceeded the design capacity of the pool structure resulting in the observed failure and buckling of the pool liner and uplift of the Styrofoam stairs.

"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following was noted:

Observed Damages

The pool has uplifted resulting in the coping paver to also uplift with the pool shell as well. Images 3 – 4



We also noted cracking and deflection within the southern side of the pool shell. Images 5 – 6



The Insured also advised that the pool floor has deformed and is drummy underneath. 



Review of Historical Nearmap Imagery



Cause of Observed Bulging

The Insured has advised that there have not been any issues with loss of water from the pool which indicates that there are no issues with the pool plumbing or leaking from the pool shell. 



As such, in our opinion, the observed damages are not a result of issues with the pool plumbing. 



From review of the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) weather records for Norah Head (approximately 15km from the subject property), approximately 300mm of rain fell from 7 – 10 February 2020, refer to Appendix A.



The Insured has advised that during the storm event the pool was required to be drained twice to restore the water level back to normal. 



This indicates the significant volume of water which has inundated the pool and the surrounding pool area as a result of the storm event. 



We noted a strip drain adjacent to the rear of the house however, in our opinion, this is not sufficient to adequately drain surface water within the pool area during the subject storm event. Image 7



As such, in our opinion, the significant volume of rain water has resulted in the pool and the surrounding pool area becoming flooded without adequate provisions for surface drainage. 



Given the insufficient surface drainage the flood water has been able to ingress through the permeable pool pavement into the underlying soil. 






This water ingress creates a significant increase in hydrostatic pressure around the pool shell which has been illustrated as Figure 2 below. 





Figure 2: Flooding of Pool Area Causes Water to Ingress into the Underlying Soil and a Significant Increase in Hydrostatic Pressure Around the Pool Shell



With reference to AS1838 – 1994 Swimming pools – Premoulded fibre-reinforced plastics – Design and Fabrication, it states that “Pools may be subject to external hydrostatic pressures, even though a hydrostatic valve is incorporated in the pool floor. Build-up of this pressure may be avoided by the incorporation of sub-surface drainage (see AS/NZS 1839)”, refer to Appendix B.



It was noted that a hydrostatic valve was installed on the base of the pool. Image 8



However, in our opinion the hydrostatic value has been has not functioned as intended. 



As such, in our opinion, the dysfunctional hydrostatic valve creates a build-up of hydrostatic pressure on the pool floor resulting in the observed lifting of the pool shell.



The observed lifting of the pool creates unsupported areas underneath the pool which was confirmed by the Insured who indicated that areas below the pool had become deformed and drummy. 

Furthermore, with reference to AS1839 – 1994 Swimming pools – Premoulded fibre-reinforced plastics – Installation, it is a requirement that subsoil drainage be provided to ensure that hydrostatic pressure does not damage the pool, refer to Appendix C.



In our opinion, subsoil drainage has been omitted during the construction of the pool which is required to intercept ground water.

 

As such, in our opinion, water ingress into the soil from the storm event has not been able to be effectively and adequately drained resulting in a significant increase in hydrostatic pressure on the pool walls causing the observed deflection and cracking within the southern pool wall.  



In summarising the cause of the observed damages outlined above we provide the schematic diagram Figure 3 below. 











Figure 3: Cause of Observed Damages to the Pool






To this end, in our opinion, the cause of the uplifting in the pool and the deflection and cracking of the southern pool wall is a result of a build-up of hydrostatic pressure due to the following issues:



Inadequate surface drainage around the pool area. 



Omission of subsoil drainage during the construction of the pool.



Lack of regular Maintenance of the Pool to Ensure as evident with the nearmaps images to ensure consistent pool water level",NA,"The insured has confirmed that there have not been any issues with water loss from the pool which indicates that the observed damages are not a result of issues with pool plumbing. 



From BOM records approximately 300mm of rain was observed in Norah Heads between 7 – 10 February 2020 which is approximately 15km away from the subject property.



In our opinion, the subject storm event has resulted in the pool area becoming flooded as a result of insufficient surface drainage around the pool area allowing flood water to ingress through the permeable pool pavement into the subsoil creating a significant increase in hydrostatic pressure around the pool shell.



Generally, inground shell swimming pools contain a hydrostatic relief valve at the base which functions to equalise the differential water head and regulate differential hydrostatic pressure between the internal and external sides of the pool.



In our opinion, the observed uplifting of the pool shell indicates that the existing hydrostatic relief valve was incorrectly installed/dysfunctional which had caused the excessive hydrostatic pressure from the groundwater to push up the base without entering the pool and deform the lining.



Furthermore, with reference to AS1839 – 1994 Swimming pools – Premoulded fibre-reinforced plastics – Installation, it is a requirement that subsoil drainage be provided to ensure that hydrostatic pressure does not damage the pool shell, which in our opinion, has been omitted during the construction of the pool.



As such, in our opinion, water ingress from the subject storm into the subsoil about the pool has resulted in a build-up of hydrostatic pressure causing the observed deflection and cracking within the southern wall of the pool.

To this end, in our opinion, the cause of the uplifting in the pool and the deflection and cracking of the southern pool wall is a result of a build-up of hydrostatic pressure due to the following issues:



Inadequate surface drainage around the pool area. 



Dysfunctional hydrostatic pressure valve.



Omission of subsoil drainage during the construction of the pool."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following was noted:

Swimming Pool Structure

The pool construction consists of metal sheets, carcass and supporting uprights which in our opinion, is typical of a pre-fabricated “above ground” swimming pool system.



At the time of our inspection, we noted a layer of bedding sand on the base of the subject pool. Image 2



Furthermore, we noted the pool has been partially constructed in an “in ground” application. Image 3



The subject pool protrudes approximately 0.4m above the ground level and it is approximately 1.3 m from the top of the pool rim to the top of the fill sand. Image 4



Given the above details, we confirm the subject swimming pool has been buried partially within ground retaining a minimum of 0.9m backfill.



As such, the embedment of the pool structure into the ground has resulted in “in-ground” application of the subject pool system contrary to the “above-ground” intended design and function.

Draining of Swimming Pool

From the Insured’s provided advice, for general maintenance of the pool, they were intending to replace the liner of the subject pool as it was last changed six (6) years ago under a previous insurance claim.



Further to the above, the Insured advised that they had engaged a contractor to replace the lining however the contractor advised that that in order to proceed with removal and replacement of the liner, the pool was required to be emptied.



At the time of our inspection, we noted a pump set up on the base of the pool in which the Insured advised it has been used to drain the water from the subject pool approximately four (4) weeks ago. Image 5



In addition to the above, at the time of our inspection, we did not note any evidence of the addition of support props to resist the earth pressure during the water removal. Image 6



In order to obtain details of the condition of the pool prior to the wall collapse, we conducted a detailed review of satellite imagery of the subject property.



From our review of the satellite imagery, provided in Figures 2 - 7 below, in our opinion, the pool was emptied sometime between November 2019 and March 2020.



Furthermore, in our opinion the pool was in poor condition and appeared to be unused for a significant period of time dating back to 2018 relative to colour of water.



Given the above, in our opinion due to the state of the pool in the years leading up to the wall buckling, the lining would have been extremely deteriorated and the environmental conditions of the pool water would have exponentially reduced the linings serviceable life.

Cause of Swimming Pool Wall Failure

In general, in-ground pools and in particular walls are subjected to two (2) loading cases namely lateral earth pressure and hydrostatic pressure acting from the backfill side.



In saying this, in contrast to “in-ground” pool systems, “above-ground” pool systems are not generally designed to withstand soil and hydrostatic pressures from the exterior of the pool and have been designed for containment of pool water pressure only.



In this case, the exerted earth and hydrostatic pressure onto the pool carcass associated with its construction in an “in-ground” system capacity is beyond the design function and intent of an “above ground” pool structure and its carcass. 



In illustrating the mechanism of failure, we have provided a schematic diagram of the earth pressure and hydrostatic pressures acting on the external face of the pool structure in Figure 8.







Figure 8 - Schematic Diagram of Resultant Internal & External Pressures Acting on the Pool Structure and Carcass Resulting in the Buckling and Damage as Observed.



On the above basis, the imbalance of the pressure between the earth pressure and the hydrostatic pressure from the due to the removal of the water in the pool has ultimately exceeded equilibrium within the pool structure’s stability causing failure and buckling about section of the carcass.



The loss of equilibrium between the resisting internal pressure and the applied external pressure has caused imbalance and ultimately the loss of the pool structural integrity. 



Furthermore, re refer to a typical structural design used commonly by the industry for the construction of the in-ground pool using the above ground system which is prepared by Rickard Engineering Reference number 10041, dated 6 October 2017. 



A copy of this structural drawing has been provided as Appendix A.



Considering the above, from review of the Rickard Engineering drawings, we provide the following comments relative to critical construction requirements:



Provided design drawing clearly indicated under Notes 4 and 5 that the pool is to be filled and in case of pool being empty, laterally is to be propped.

The aforementioned Notes are consistent with requirements to resist the hydrostatic pressure component of the loads as explained above and are specified to ensure the imbalance between the external and internal pressures does not occur.



With respect to the lateral earth pressure components of the loads, within the design drawing it is specified that the backfill of minimum 600mm wide behind the pool for clayey sites are required.

Backfill material is also specified to be mix of cement and sand with 1:8 mix ratio is to be used.

Use of cement will create a solid backfill once is installed and cement is cured bonding the sand together to ensure the backfill acts as a solid mass.

Such solid mass acts as a  gravity system retaining wall which resists the lateral earth pressure by means of dead-weight and its specified footprint.



In addition to above, a subsoil drainage system is also been specified; however, considering the above, such drainage is to mitigate durability of the steel uprights and to provide redundancy in design by reducing the long-term hydrostatic pressure. 



Notwithstanding the above, from our site inspection, we noted that the backfill is general cohesive soil rather than the specified cement-sand mix which is not consistent with the typical Rickard Engineering design.



As such, the lateral earth pressure is only resisted by the steel uprights and their footing to which as indicated above is not structurally adequate.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed damage is unrelated to an insurable event and the failure is a direct result of incorrect measures undertaken during the pool draining and inadequacy of the original pool construction.",NA,"Swimming Pool Structure



The subject pool protrudes approximately 0.4m above the ground level and it is approximately 1.3 m from the top of the pool rim to the top of the fill sand.



Given the above details, we confirm the subject swimming pool has been buried a minimum of 0.9m below the ground surface.



As such, the embedment of the pool structure into the ground has resulted in “in-ground” application of the subject pool system contrary to the “above-ground” intended design and function.

Draining of Swimming Pool

From review of satellite imagery provided in the figures below, in our opinion, the pool was emptied sometime between November 2019 and March 2020.



Furthermore, in our opinion the pool was in poor condition and appeared to be unused for a significant period of time dating back to 2018.



Due to the structural characteristics of an above ground swimming pool and with reference to the typical structural design by Rickard Engineering, we confirm that the subject pool had been drained incorrectly and was left in a compromised state for an extended period of time.

Cause of Swimming Pool Failure

To this end, in our opinion, the observed damage is unrelated to an insurable event and the failure is a direct result of the following measures: 


Incorrect measures undertaken during the pool draining relateive to absence of propping the walls;


Leaving the subject pool unsupported in a compromised state;


Inadequate maintenance practice in prior years; and


Inadequacy of the original pool construction."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following were noted.

Observed Damages

From our observations about the fibreglass swimming pool, we noted cracking and deformation about the corners of the pool, indicating the pool shell has experienced significant applied forces and movement beyond its design intent. Images 3 & 4

We noted inward bulging of the pool shell walls about the pool, indicating the pool shell had experienced inward horizontal pressures beyond its design intent. Images 4-7

From our observations about the backyard, we noted the brick pavers about the pool were permeable, facilitating ingress of surface water into the soil below which forms the backfill around the pool.

We further noted that the pavers about the backyard were uneven, indicating subsidence of the below soil had occurred due to inundation with surface water. Images 8-10

We noted the adjacent grass area had provisions for subsoil drainage, however the drainage pipes evidently discharged directly onto the paved area below rather that into the stormwater system. Image 11

We advise that this arrangement would result in excess surface water runoff onto the paved area which would subsequently permeate through the pavers and into the backfill soil around the pool.

Overall, we did not note any effective provisions for drainage of surface stormwater about the backyard.

Review of Historical Nearmap Imagery

In seeking to determine the recent condition of the pool to the present, we have reviewed historic satellite imagery taken from Nearmap.

From the aforementioned review, we have identified maintenance issues within the pool spanning across a period of approximately one (1) year.

In summarising our observations, we provide Table 1 below, which references the relevant satellite images in Appendix A.

Table 1 – s from review of Nearmap historic satellite imagery

Nearmap Image Date

s and Comments

Appendix A Image Reference

March 2019

From satellite imagery, it is evident that the pool has been well maintained to this point, as evidenced by consistently clear blue water visible back to the earliest available Nearmap satellite imagery taken in 2010.

A

May 2019

A light-blue pool cover has been put in place across the pool water.

B

July 2019

The pool cover has come loose, exposing the pool water. The pool water appears dark and murky indicating it has not been maintained.

C

October 2019

The pool cover has further dislodged, exposing the majority of the pool water which was still murky.

D

November 2019

The pool cover has been removed. The pool water was still murky and contained debris.

E

March 2020

Several of the steps within the pool are visible through the murky water indicating the water level has dropped significantly through evaporation.

F

June 2020

The pool has been covered again, although the cover is loose and most of the water surface remains exposed. The pool water remained murky.

G

September 2020

The pool has been uncovered and the water appears clean and fresh, indicating pool maintenance has been recently carried out for the first time since May 2019.

H

December 2020

The pool water remains uncovered and the water relatively clean, although debris has begun to accumulate.

I



On the basis of the above, it is evident that the pool has not been maintained over the period between May 2019 and June 2020, evidenced by consistently unclean water and a drop in the level of the pool water.

Cause of Observed Bulging

Based on our observations of inadequate surface drainage provisions, permeable pavers and soil subsidence outlined above, it is evident that the soil about the pool has been inundated with water during rainfalls.

We advise that this would result in the water table rising around the pool backfill, applying inward horizontal hydrostatic pressure to the pool walls in addition to the pre-existing inward lateral earth pressures.

We advise that fibreglass pools require a subsoil drainage layer around the pool shell to discharge ground water and prevent excess hydrostatic pressure build up which can deform and damage the pool shell.

We confirm that, although a hydrostatic valve was observed within the pool, this is not sufficient to relieve external hydrostatic pressure build-up in the absence of an appropriate drainage layer.

We reference AS 1838 – 1994 Swimming pools – Premoulded fibre-reinforced plastics – Design and Fabrication (Appendix B) which states “Pools may be subject to external hydrostatic pressures, even though a hydrostatic valve is incorporated in the pool floor. Build-up of this pressure may be avoided by the incorporation of sub-surface drainage”

We further reference AS 1839 – 1994 Swimming pools – Premoulded fibre-reinforced plastics – Installation (Appendix C) which requires that subsoil drainage be provided to ensure that hydrostatic pressure does not damage the pool.

Based on our observations, in our opinion, subsoil drainage about the pool has been omitted during the original construction, allowing the surrounding soil to be inundated with stormwater leading to hydrostatic pressure to build up against the pool walls.

Further to the above, we advise that the water level in fibreglass pools must be maintained at all times to ensure a consistent outwards pressure which resists the inwards pressure applied by soil and water around the pool, and prevents excessive deformation and damage to the pool shell.





To the above point, it is evident that that pool level has dropped significantly between May 2019 and June 2020, as discussed above, exposing the pool shell to the risk of damage caused by external soil and water pressure.

As discussed, the pool was unmaintained and substantially uncovered for approximately one (1) year, to which we advise that evaporation from an uncovered pool is typically between 3mm and 7mm per day equating to a drop in water level between 500mm up to 1.2m over a six (6) month period.

Based on the above, and pending inspection and reporting by a qualified plumber, in our opinion the drop in water level within the pool has been caused by lack of maintenance rather than any alleged leak from the pool.

In schematically illustrating the above points, we provide Figure 2 below.



Figure 2 - Schematic illustration of forces acting on swimming pool



In our opinion, the experienced pool damage has been caused by the following:

Inadequate provision of surface drainage around the pool area resulting in inundation of the soil about the pool with stormwater.

Omission of a sub-soil drainage layer, as required by Australian Standards, allowing build-up of external hydrostatic pressure about the pool shell.

Lack of maintenance resulting in the pool level dropping over a period of approximately one (1) year, and in turn resulting in the loss of internal pressure required for equilibrium against external forces.

To this end, in our opinion, the experienced pool damage is due to lack of maintenance and inadequate stormwater drainage provisions and not attributable to any one-off storm event.",NA,"During our inspection, we noted evidence of damage to the pool shell in the form of cracking and deformation at corners and inwards bulging of pool walls, indicating the pool walls had been exposed to excessive inward lateral pressures.

We observed inadequate stormwater drainage provisions and evidence of soil subsistence about the pool, indicating the pool area had been inundated with stormwater, which in turn would have resulted in an increase of hydrostatic pressure in the soil around the pool.

From review of historic satellite imagery, we noted that the pool had not been maintained or properly covered over the period May 2019 and June 2020, resulting in the pool water level dropping significantly due to evaporation.

Pending inspection and reporting by a qualified plumber, in our opinion the drop in water level within the pool has been caused by lack of maintenance rather than any alleged leak from the pool.

We advise that drop in water level has resulted in a corresponding drop in equalizing internal pressures which counter balance the external lateral earth and hydrostatic pressures applied to the pool shell, exposing the pool shell to the risk of damage caused by external soil and hydrostatic pressure.

In our opinion, the experienced pool damage has been caused by the following:

Inadequate surface drainage provisions about the pool area resulting in inundation of the soil about the pool with stormwater which is evidenced by exhibited subsidence within the surrounding pavers.

Omission of sub-soil drainage layer allowing build-up of external hydrostatic pressure against the pool shell.

Lack of maintenance resulting in the pool level dropping significantly over a period of approximately one (1) year, and in turn resulting in the loss of internal pressure required for equilibrium against external earth and hydrostatic pressures.

To this end, in our opinion, the experienced pool damage is due to lack of maintenance and inadequate stormwater drainage provisions, and not attributable to any one-off storm event."

Boundary Retaining Wall



Our inspection was generally undertaken within the property confinements of 27 Allawah Avenue; however, we note that the subject retaining wall also forms part of the rear boundary of 25 Allawah Avenue, 12A Gnarbo Avenue & 14A Gnarbo Avenue. 



We note that the boundary retaining wall, which is located about the South-Western boundary of 27 Allawah Ave has partially collapsed. Image 3 – 5



From our on-site measurements, the length of the collapsed retaining wall is approximately 12Lm in length. 



The construction of the subject boundary retaining wall consists of the following elements:



Original sandstone retaining wall which reduces in height along the northern alignment of the retaining wall. Images 6 – 8



Approximately 1m high 230mm thick solid brick retaining wall constructed off a concrete footing above the existing sandstone retaining wall (pertaining to 12A Gnarbo Avenue). Images 9 – 10



We note that the average retaining wall height was approximately 2m along the length of the collapsed wall. Image 11



From review of the survey plan, the top of the wall RL is shown as 25.03, and the rear yard of 12A Gnarbo Ave having an RL of 24.9, which indicates that the brick wall was retaining soil up to a height of approximately 130mm below the top of the wall (or a retained soil height of approximately 1.9m).



From inspection of the collapsed soil behind the subject retaining wall, we confirm that we did not observe any subsoil drainage or free-draining material. Images 12



We also have undertaken inspection of the remaining sandstone retaining wall still intact adjacent to the collapsed retaining wall to which we noted cracking, erosion and movement to the wall. Images 13 – 14



We further noted large trees in close proximity to the northern alignment of the subject retaining wall. Image 15



Sewer Service



The Insured advised that as a result of the retaining wall failure that the sewer line servicing 12A Gnarbo Ave was damaged, to which temporary infrastructure has been installed to service 12A Gnarbo Ave. Image 16



The Insured advised that they did not note any sewerage smell prior to the collapse of the retaining wall.



Additional Concerns



During our inspection, the Insured also advised that since the collapse of the subject retaining wall additional surface water has flowed onto the subject property which has caused the following to occur:



Sandstone garden edging to dislodge and collapse. Images 17 – 18



Water ingress within the lower-level garage of the subject property. Images 19 – 20



From inspection within the subfloor adjacent to the garage, we note that the soil was generally damp on the surface adjacent to the external brick dwarf wall. Image 21



We further confirm that we did not observe any subsoil, drainage within the subfloor area, or surface drainage adjacent to the subfloor area.","Retaining Wall Age & Condition

We have undertaken review of historical imagery from the NSW government Website, to which it is evident that the construction of the subject Sandstone retaining wall was undertaken circa 1960’s during subdivision of the adjoining land. 



Given the above, we estimate that the subject original stone retaining wall is in excess of 50 years in age to which the retaining wall construction pre-dates the inception of the BCA and AS4678-2002 Earth-retaining structures.



As outlined above, the adjacent intact stone retaining wall was evidently in a cracked and eroded state, which in our opinion, is a result of long-term weather exposure and gradual tree root growth below the subject retaining wall. 

Based on the age and condition of the remaining intact stone retaining wall, in our opinion, the stone retaining wall has surpassed its serviceable design life.



Notwithstanding the above, it is evident that the brick retaining wall was constructed after the construction of the Sandstone retaining wall to level the rear yard of 12A Gnarbo Avenue. 



From review of the subject brickwork retaining structure, we estimate that the retaining wall was constructed circa 1980’s and also pre-dates the inception of the BCA and AS4678-2002 Earth-retaining structures.

Neighbouring Stormwater Runoff & Drainage

The Insured has raised concerns regarding neighbouring stormwater runoff, which they believe is the underlying cause of failure of the subject retaining wall. 



Notwithstanding the above, we have undertaken review of the neighbouring stormwater drainage based solely from inspection within 27 Allawah Avenue and review of the survey.



From review of the survey, we note that the rear yard of 12A Gnarbo Avenue has one (1) 470mm deep stormwater pit to collect stormwater runoff throughout the entire yard of 12A Gnarbo Avenue.



We are not privy to the details of the subject stormwater pit, nor did our inspection include for a detailed assessment of the stormwater drainage within 12A Gnarbo Avenue as our access was limited to 27 Allawah Avenue.



However, as noted above, we did not observe any subsoil drainage behind the subject retaining wall, which is essential in alleviating hydrostatic pressure build-up behind the retaining wall system, which is described within AS 4678-2002 Clause 3.6 (see Figure 3 below). 





Figure 3: Extract from AS4678-2002 (Clause 3.6 Drainage)

Based on our observations, in our opinion, the observed surface & subsoil drainage provisions behind the retaining wall were insufficient to alleviate the build-up of hydrostatic pressure behind the subject retaining wall.

Stormwater/Sewer Contribution

We have undertaken assessment of whether the water services located behind the subject wall had any bearing on the wall failure.



However, as the Insured has stated, they did not note any sewer smell prior to the wall collapse. 



Furthermore, we did not observe any localised erosion which we would expect to occur should localised breakage within a sewer/stormwater occur.



Based on the above, in our opinion, the retaining wall failure has not been caused by a breakage within stormwater/sewer services located behind the subject wall, but rather the retaining wall failure has led to damage to the services located behind the subject retaining wall.

Experienced Rainfall



From review of Nearmap imagery, we note that the claimed date of loss is in-line with the Insureds provided advice (see Appendix B). 



As such, we have undertaken review of the Rainfall data collected at the Bureau of Meteorology Peakhurst Golf Club Station (which is located approximately 6km from the subject property) for March 2021, see Appendix C.



From review of the Rainfall data, we note that between 19 March 2021 and 24 March 2021, approximately 334mm of rainfall was recorded. 



Such amount of rainfall and absence of sufficient surface and subsoil drainage behind the subject retaining wall will result in a significant increase in the hydrostatic pressure imposed onto the subject retaining wall. 

Proximate Cause of Retaining Wall Failure



From review of the failure pattern observed at the time of our inspection, in our opinion, the sandstone retaining wall has failed which has caused the retained soil to become unstable and subsequently ‘slump’. 

In our opinion, the slumping of the soil has caused the upper brick retaining wall to become undermined and subsequently rotate and fail as well.



Based on our on-site observations, in our opinion, the following are the underlying contributing factors to the retaining wall collapse:



Omission of sufficient surface and subsoil drainage which has allowed build-up of hydrostatic pressure behind the subject retaining wall. 



Long-term deterioration of the sandstone retaining wall which has ultimately compromised the structural integrity and stability of the retaining wall system.



In schematically illustrating the above-mentioned failure mechanism of the retaining wall, we provide Figure 4 below.





Figure 4: Proximate Failure Mechanism of the Subject Retaining Wall

To this end, in our opinion, the underlying cause of the retaining wall failure is due to inherent construction issues and long-term deterioration of the stone retaining wall, to which the heavy rainfall in March 2021 has only triggered the inevitable failure of the subject retaining wall.

Make-Safe Works & Reinstatement

At this stage, we confirm that the collapsed debris is currently in a stable condition, however recommend that the debris be removed as soon as practical.



However, the exposed soil face is at risk of erosion, to which we recommend that the soil face be protected through the installation of waterproof tarpaulin and tie-downs to divert stormwater during heavy rainfall. 



Notwithstanding the above, the boundary wall between 12A Gnarbo Avenue & 14A Gnarbo Avenue is currently partially undermined. Image 22



Given the above, we recommend that the unsupported retaining wall be temporarily propped and braced until permanent rectification works are able to be undertaken.



We note that the subject retaining wall be will required to be reconstructed, which will require a Development Approval and Structural design which has been outlined within the Recommendations section of this report.



Retaining Wall Ownership, Liability and Benefit

We advise that Silver Wolf Projects is not qualified to provide legal advice on retaining wall ownership and liability as this relates to common law practice and is for guidance only and is to be formally verified by a practicing Solicitor. 



In providing recommendation in retaining wall ownership, we have investigated possible defining parameters in both retaining wall and fence constructions. 



From our review, the subject retaining wall and supported boundary fence have been constructed on the common boundary line between the Insured’s property and neighbouring properties at 25 Allawah Avenue, Carss Park, 27 Allawah Avenue Carss Park & 12A Gnarbo Avenue Carss Park.



We further note that the stone retaining wall extends along the common boundary between 27 Allawah Avenue Carss Park & 14A Gnarbo Avenue Carss Park.



In illustrating the location of the retaining wall along the boundaries of the abovementioned properties, a schematic annotated plan has been provided in Figure 5.

Figure 5 – Schematic Location of Retaining Wall Along Property Boundaries



From our research which has been obtained through Legal Services Commission of South Australia, there is no conclusive legislative document to rule the liability of the adjoining owners relative to retaining wall construction and maintenance along the property boundaries. 



It is our understanding that law concerning retaining walls is principally conducted under common law of nuisance and, where retaining walls were constructed after 15 January 1994, under the Development Act 1993. 



In determining the ownership, liability and benefit of all parties, we provide the following qualifications. 



Given the location of the retaining wall along the common boundary line, in our opinion, the Insured, the Owners of 12A & 14A Gnarbo Ave, Carss Park and the Owner of 25 Allawah Ave, Carss Park all have ownership of the wall. 



However, liability of a retaining wall is defined by its benefit with respect to the requirement or need to support or retain fill for the purposes of development due to altering the natural state of the land. 



Benefit of the retaining wall is where it is constructed to enable the Owner to preform building works that affects the stability of the adjoining land and is required to support change in the natural state of land. 



Notwithstanding the shared location about the boundary alignment, benefit of the retaining wall was for the retention of soil within 12A Gnarbo Ave, Carss.  



On the basis of the above, in our opinion, we envisage that the Owner of 12A Gnarbo Ave, Carss Park would be responsible for the majority of the incurred cost in the rectification works to the subject retaining wall.

Additional Concerns

Garden Edging & Water Ingress in Basement



Whilst we note that the retaining wall failure will facilitate additional water flow onto the Insured property, in our opinion, the increased water flow will not be sufficient to result in the observed collapsed of the sandstone garden bed edging. 



In our opinion, the garden bed edging has become dislodged over an extended period of time due to vegetation growth behind the edging, to which stormwater runoff has only triggered the collapse of the sandstone edging.



As such, in our opinion, the observed dislodgment of the sandstone is unrelated to the collapse of the subject retaining wall.



Furthermore, as noted above, we did not observe any surface or subsoil drainage to mitigate water ingress within the subfloor. 



We confirm that we did not observe any resultant damage within the garage, to which the Insured advised that they had patched sections of the concrete garage walls in attempt to mitigate future water ingress. 



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, the water ingress within the garage is due to insufficient surface and subsoil drainage provisions to mitigate water ingress within the property subfloor and is unrelated to the collapse of the subject retaining wall.","We note that the subject retaining wall failure is common to the boundary of the following property:



27 Allawah Avenue Carss Park & 12A Gnarbo Avenue Carss Park.

25 Allawah Avenue Carss Park & 12A Gnarbo Avenue Carss Park.



The failed retaining wall consists of an original sandstone retaining wall with a brick retaining wall constructed on top of the stone retaining wall, to which the retained soil was approximately 130mm lower than the top of the brick retaining wall.



The failed section of retaining wall extends for an approximate length of 12Lm.

Drainage Concerns

The Insured raised concerns regarding drainage on the neighbouring property, which is believed to have been the cause of the retaining wall failure. 



We have undertaken assessment of the drainage based on our visual assessment within 27 Allawah Avenue, to which we confirm that we did not observe any evidence of subsoil drainage or surface drainage within the collapsed debris and soil behind the subject retaining wall. 



Whilst we note that the age of the retaining wall pre-dated the inception of AS4678:2002, the drainage considerations outlined within this Australian Standards states that:



“Drainage and the possible development of pore water pressure within a soil are amongst important considerations in the design of retaining structures because the presence of water behind an earth-retaining structure has a significant effect on the pressures applied to the structure. Even when there is no water in direct contact with the structure, increased pressures can occur on a retaining structure due to an elevated phreatic surface developed from water seepage into the failure wedge behind the structure.”

Based on our visual assessment, in our opinion, the inadequate surface and subsoil drainage provisions behind the retaining wall has allowed the build-up of hydrostatic pressure behind the retaining wall which has contributed to its failure.

Stormwater/Sewer Contribution

During our inspection, the Insured advised they did not note any sewerage smell prior to the collapse of the retaining wall. 



Furthermore, we further confirm that we did not observe any localised erosion to the soil which we would have expected to observe should a breakage within the pipe infrastructure located behind the retaining wall have caused the observed collapse. 



Based on the above, in our opinion, the retaining wall failure has not been caused by a breakage within stormwater/sewer services located behind the subject wall, but rather the retaining wall failure has led to damage to the services located behind the subject retaining wall.

Experienced Rainfall

From review of Nearmap imagery, we note that the claimed timeline of the retaining wall collapse is in-line with the Insureds provided advice being around 23 March 2021. 



From review of rainfall data from Peakhurst Golf Club for March 2021, we note that between 19 March 2021 and 24 March 2021, approximately 334mm of rainfall was recorded. 



Without adequate surface and subsoil drainage, the experienced rainfall would have resulted in a significant build-up of hydrostatic pressure behind the subject retaining wall. 

Proximate Cause of Retaining Wall Failure

From review of the subject retaining wall failure, it is evident that the lower sandstone retaining wall has failed, which has caused the retained soil to ‘slump’ and the brick retaining wall to subsequently rotate and fail. 



We have undertaken inspection of the intact sandstone retaining wall adjacent to the collapsed retaining wall to which we note that the wall is in a cracked and eroded state. 



Such cracking and erosion are consistent with long-term weather exposure and gradual tree root growth below the subject retaining wall.



Given the above, in our opinion, the sandstone retaining wall was in a deteriorated and compromised condition prior to its collapse. 



Based on our on-site observations, in our opinion, the following are the underlying contributing factors to the retaining wall collapse:



Omission of sufficient surface and subsoil drainage which has allowed build-up of hydrostatic pressure behind the subject retaining wall. 



Long-term deterioration of the sandstone retaining wall which has ultimately compromised the structural integrity and stability of the retaining wall system.



To this end, in our opinion, the underlying cause of the retaining wall failure is due to inherent construction issues and long-term deterioration of the wall, to which the heavy rainfall in March 2021 has only triggered the inevitable failure of the retaining wall.

Additional Concerns

During our inspection, the Insured raised additional concerns regarding additional stormwater runoff within the property which has been claimed to have resulted in the following:



Dislodgement of sandstone garden edging. 

Water ingress within the basement.



Whilst we note that the retaining wall collapse would result in an increase of stormwater runoff on the subject property, in our opinion, this is insufficient in magnitude to result in the above-mentioned issues. 



Based on the above, in our opinion, the dislodgement of the sandstone garden edging is due to long-term root pressure imposed from on-going gradual vegetation growth behind the edging and is unrelated to the subject retaining wall collapse. 



Furthermore, in our opinion, the water ingress within the garage of the subject property is due to omission of sufficient surface and subsoil drainage about external garage wall which has allowed water to ingress through the wall during heavy rainfall. 



Given the above, in our opinion, the water ingress within the garage is unrelated to the subject retaining wall collapse but rather a result of inherent construction issues."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following was noted:

s

Damage to Easement



At the time of our inspection, we noted movement to the concrete and stone blocks which resulted in partial collapse of the retaining wall. Images 1 – 5  



From your provided advice, the exhibited wall failure has occurred during the recent heavy storms.



We advise the structural integrity of the retaining wall has been compromised, requiring demolition and reconstruction to ensure long-term performance and longevity of the easement. 



Damage to Property



Behind the collapsed retaining wall, we noted mobilisation of soil within the subject property’s rear lawn. Images 6 – 8   



From our onsite measurements, we advise that a strip of the lawn approximately 1.7m from the boundary fence has collapsed towards the easement. Image 9 



Based on the above evidence, we advise the observed earth movement is consistent with the experienced retaining wall collapse and subsequent landslide. 



However, beyond this point we did not observe further earth movement about the rear lawn. Images 10 & 11



In addition to the above, we also noted horizonal crack to one (1) of the isolated piers within the subfloor, to which we consider such crack is superficial and cosmetic in nature. Image 12  



Irrespective of the above, no damage or cracking was noted to the external wall within the north elevation facing the easement. Images 13 – 17  



From our observations, the observed cracking is located outside the zone of influence and, in our opinion, is unrelated to the retaining wall collapse. 



In our opinion, the observed crack failure pattern is consistent with movement of the floor framework due to seasonal thermal movement, rather than earth movement due to the experienced landslide. 



Notwithstanding the above, we did not identify any adverse damage, movement or distress to any of the structural elements within the north elevation as a result of the retaining wall collapse. 



At this stage, we advise the retaining wall collapse has no structural bearing to the subject property and the Insured is able to move back into the property with an exclusion zone established as make safe works as per our email. Refer to Appendix A",NA,"Retaining Wall



At the time of our inspection, we confirm partial collapse to the retaining wall, consistent with the provided advice as a result of the flooding of the easement during the recent storms. 



We advise the observed earth movement is consistent with the experienced retaining wall collapse and subsequent landslide.



We advise the structural integrity of the retaining wall has been comprised, requiring demolition and reconstruction to ensure long-term performance and longevity of the easement.



Structural Integrity of the Building



As a result of the retaining wall collapse, we observed partial mobilisation of the rear lawn approximately 1.7m from the boundary fence. 



However beyond this point, we noted the lawn was in stable condition and has not been affected by the retaining wall collapse. 



From our inspection, we only noted horizontal cracking to one (1) of the isolated piers within the subfloor, which in opinion, is a result of seasonal thermal movement of the floor framework rather than earth movement. 



Irrespective of the above, we confirm that we did not observe any structural damage to the building in the absence of cracking, movement or distress to the structural elements within the north elevation facing the subject retaining wall. 



To this end, we advise that the structural integrity of building has not been compromised relative to the lack of damage to the dwelling outside of partial earth movement within the rear lawn following the retaining wall collapse."
"For clarity and identification purposes, refer to the schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism of the observed collapse and failure mode within the brick retaining wall in Appendix A.

Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following was noted:

s



From our on-site inspection and measurement, we noted the approximate height of the collapsed retaining wall varied from 0.70m to 1.8m which constructed in 230mm thick double brick material. Images 8



We also noted a steel wire mesh fence has been installed in front of the subject retaining wall. Image 8.



We observed the subject retaining wall has been partially collapsed about the western alignment of the tennis court. Images 2-7.



We also noted the steel wire mesh fence adjacent to the collapsed retaining wall has been rotated as a result of the impact from retaining wall collapse. Images 5.



From our inspection of the collapsed soil behind the subject retaining wall, we were unable to identify any subsoil drainage or draining material. Image 11



In addition, we noted the eastern section of the subject retaining wall has also been rotated towards the tennis court which in our opinion, is as a result of an on-going failure within the wall over the time. Images 9-10.



We also identified trees and vegetation grown just behind the subject retaining wall. Image 2.



We also noted no make safe work has been undertaken by the contractor around the collapsed section of the retaining wall in restricting the public access to site. Image 8","Review of retaining wall construction

From review of the brick retaining wall construction, the subject retaining wall is a cantilevered “gravity” based system, where capacity to resist soil, surcharge and hydrostatic pressure reliant on the self-weight of the retaining wall structure. 



In this case, from our on-site observations, the subject wall was 230mm thick double brick wall retaining a maximum fill height of 1.8m. 



In-line with general engineering principals, generally the thickness of the base of gravity-based system is 0.6 x height of the wall, which in this case would be approximately 1000mm. 



We have undertaken structural review of the capacity and stability of the subject gravity-based retaining wall, and confirm that the weight of the retaining wall is grossly insufficient to withstand the applied loading from active soil pressure, surcharge, hydrostatic pressure and root growth of the vegetation within the subsoil.



As such, we confirm that the construction and the design of the subject retaining wall was not in-line with general engineering principles to withstand the typical applied loading onto a retaining wall. 

Proximate Cause of Retaining Wall Collapse

We have undertaken inspection of the subject brick retaining wall to which we note that the other sections of the wall (particularly eastern alignment) are in a rotated state.



We note that the previous damage within the retaining wall may have occurred as a result of an ongoing failure within the wall. 



From the retaining wall design point of view, the subject “gravity” retaining wall is grossly inadequate to withstand the applied loading from active soil pressure, surcharge, hydrostatic pressure and root growth of the vegetation within the subsoil.



Given the above, in our opinion, the following are the underlying contributing factors to the retaining wall collapse:



Insufficient size of the retaining wall to act as a gravity system to withstand the typical applied loading.



Omission of sufficient subsoil drainage which has allowed build-up of hydrostatic pressure behind the subject retaining wall. 



Root growth of vegetation within the subsoil.



To this end, in our opinion, the proximate cause of the retaining wall collapse was due to inherent construction issues and rooting pressure from vegetation grown within the subsoil.","From structural review, the weight of the “gravity” retaining wall is grossly insufficient in weight to withstand the applied loading from active soil pressure, surcharge, hydrostatic pressure and root growth of the vegetation within the subsoil.



In addition, it is clearly seen from the remaining brick retaining wall adjacent to the collapsed section is in on-going failure state.



Based on our review, in our opinion, the following are the underlying contributing factors to the retaining wall collapse:



Insufficient size of the retaining wall to act as a gravity system to withstand the typical applied loading.



Omission of sufficient subsoil drainage which has allowed build-up of hydrostatic pressure behind the subject retaining wall. 



Root growth of vegetation within the subsoil.



To this end, in our opinion, the proximate cause of the retaining wall collapse was due to inherent construction issues and rooting pressure from vegetation grown within the subsoil."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of Brett Robinson, representative of the Church to which the following was noted:



Images of the water damage within the new section of the church from the storm in February 2020 and July 2020 have been provided by Brett Robinson which have been attached as Appendix B and Appendix C respectively. 



It is understood that Kase Building Group (KASE) were in the process of finishing off the reinstatement works for the damage caused by the February 2020 when water ingress reoccurred during the July 2020 storm.

Points of Water Ingress

New Section of Church – Southern Eastern Areas



Based on the provided images from the February 2020 and July 2020 storm we noted water damage within the following rooms of the new section of the Church:



Store Room

Cry Room

Foyer

South-eastern area of the Auditorium

Recording room.



It was advised that KASE had dried the water ingress from the July 2020 storm in attempt to save building fabrics from being damaged. 



At the time of our inspection we noted that most of the above-mentioned rooms were in a dry state with the exception of slight water ingress within the Store room. Images 3 – 6



From review of the Bureau of Meteorology weather data for Sydney Airport we note that approximately 55mm of rain fell between 8 – 10 August 2020, refer to Appendix D. 



During our inspection it was advised that in attempt to mitigate further water ingress from the rain experienced in the days prior to our inspection that builder’s plastic had been placed on the southern side of the church. Image 7



Old Church – Northern Eastern Office



It has been advised that during the February 2020 and July 2020 storm that water ingress had been experienced within the North-Eastern office of the old church.



It was further advised that the smoke alarm had stopped working after the July 2020 storm due to water ingress and that the insulation within the ceiling cavity was also wet. Image 8



During our inspection we noted that the plasterboard ceiling lining was in a dry state and Brett Robinson also confirmed that the insulation within the ceiling cavity was also dry. Image 9



It was also advised that water ingress had been experienced with the Ground level kitchen about the North Eastern side of the church, however that remedial works had been undertaken and no water ingress has since been experienced within this area. 

Cause of Water Ingress

New Section of Church – Southern Eastern Areas



Based on our internal inspection of the damaged areas of new church, it is evident that the water ingress has not occurred from the roof given no damage was observed to the ceiling linings. 



In determining the cause of water ingress about the south-eastern areas of the new section of the church we have undertaken inspection of the southern elevation. 



We note that the external area adjacent to the areas of water ingress are higher than the internal areas. 



Brett Robinson advised that he understands that when the new section of the church was constructed that water ingress had been experienced and that remedial works had subsequently been undertaken to mitigate such water ingress.



From our external inspection we noted evidence of previous application of waterproofing consistent with previous attempt to mitigate water ingress. Image 10



With reference to typical waterproofing products, liquid applied waterproofing membranes typically have a lifespan of 10-15 years before progressive failures occur which such lifespan is consistent with the age of the building. 



The recent water ingress within the subject building also indicates that previous waterproofing membrane application in mitigating water ingress had failed.



Furthermore, it is noted that the only damage caused by the rainfall in the days prior to our inspection was minor water ingress within the Store room. 



As such, it is evident that the builder’s plastic installed on the southern elevation has reduced the amount of water ingress within the subject property. Images 11 – 12



We also observed water ingress within the wall cavity adjacent to the new section of the church to which we also note that the opening within the brickwork has been covered using FC sheet which has not been sealed around the edges. Images 13 – 14



Based on the provided advice and our observations about the areas of water ingress, in our opinion, the cause of water ingress is a result of the following:



Failed waterproofing on the old section of the church which has allowed water to permeate through the brickwork and into the wall cavity and subsequently into the internal areas of the church. 



Omission/failed damp-proof course which allows water entrapped within the brick cavity to build up and subsequently permeate into the internal areas of the church. 



Insufficient seal around brickwork openings allowing water ingress into the wall cavity and subsequently into the internal areas.



Failed waterproofing on the new section of the church allowing ground water to permeate through joins within the precast concrete panels and into the internal areas of the church. 



Water permeating through the join between the original brickwork and new precast panel due to insufficient seal. Image 15



In illustrating the above-mentioned cause of water ingress within the south-eastern area of the new church, we provide Figure 2 below illustrating water permeating through the old church brickwork and Figure 3 below illustrating water permeating through the new church precast concrete panels.





Figure 2: Water Permeating into the Brick Wall Cavity Is Able to Subsequently Permeate into the Internal Areas




Figure 3: Failed/Omission of Waterproofing Allows Water to Permeate Through Joins Within the Precast Panels









Old Church – Northern Eastern Office



In determining the cause of water ingress within the north-eastern office of the old church we have undertaken inspection of the roof above the area of water ingress.



From our inspection of the roof above the north-eastern office, we noted the following issues: 



Apron flashing between the roof tiles and sheet metal roof has been downturned allowing water to ingress behind the flashing. Images 16 – 17 



Gaps within the FC sheet parapet below the roof tiles which have not been adequately sealed which allows water ingress during directional/wind driven rainfall. Image 18



Unsealed gaps in parapet apron flashing which allows water ingress behind the flashing during directional and wind drive rainfall. Image 19



Previous patch repair of join between the tiled roof and sheet metal roof using flexible waterproofing sheet indicating pre-existing issues with the join between the roof sheeting and tiled roof. Image 20 – 21



Gap between the roof tiles and flashing at the top of the sheet metal roof allowing wind drive rain to penetrate below the roof tiles. Image 21



Penetrations/Holes within the roof sheeting which has not been sealed which will allow water ingress below the roof sheeting. Image 22



Cracking within the FC sheet parapet. Image 23



Deteriorated flexible sealant with FC sheet parapet joints. Image 24



Inadequately sealed penetrations through FC Sheet Parapet. Image 25



Services within the roof sheeting with deteriorated flexible sealant around the services/penetrations, it is also noted that these services also obstruct water flow during rainfall. Image 26 



Based on our inspection of the roof above the north-eastern office roof, it is evident that there are multiple points of water ingress which are outlined above. 



We confirm that we did not observe any storm created opening within the roof above the North-Eastern office of the old church.



As such, in our opinion, the cause of water ingress is a result of inherent building defects and long-term deterioration of sealant and sheeting, unrelated to any one-off or insurable event.

Whether ongoing drainage works to the exterior of the property has caused or contributed to water ingress from storm event 26 July;



It was advised at the time of our inspection that remedial works were taking placed about the southern side of the Church and that the area was exposed during the storm event on 26 July.



Based on the provided images and our observations, it is evident that water was able to more easily permeate into the ground due to the removal of sections of the slab on ground on the southern side of the property.



In our opinion, the ongoing drainage works during the storm event on 26 July 2020 would have contributed to the water ingress, however was not the underlying cause of water ingress during the subject storm.

Provide recommended scope of work for any remedial repairs required and waterproofing/drainage rectification to avoid further water ingress in the future



In keeping inline with your instruction, we have prepared a separate remedial scope of works (SWP-SoW-2001935) to provide recommendations regarding mitigating further water ingress in the future.",NA,"Points of Water Ingress and Cause of Water Ingress

New Section of Church – Southern Eastern Areas



Based on the provided images from the February 2020 and July 2020 storm we noted water damage within the following rooms of the new section of the Church:



Store Room

Cry Room

Foyer

South-eastern area of the Auditorium

Recording room.

Based on our observations about the areas of water ingress, in our opinion, the cause of water ingress is a result of the following:



Failed waterproofing on the old section of the church which has allowed water to permeate through the brickwork and into the wall cavity and subsequently into the internal areas of the church. 



Omission/failed damp-proof course which allows water entrapped within the brick cavity to build up and subsequently permeate into the internal areas of the church. 



Insufficient seal around brickwork openings allowing water ingress into the wall cavity and subsequently into the internal areas.



Failed waterproofing on the new section of the church allowing ground water to permeate through joins within the precast concrete panels and into the internal areas of the church. 



Water permeating through the join between the original brickwork and new precast panel due to insufficient seal. 



Old Church – Northern Eastern Office



It has been advised that during the February 2020 and July 2020 storm that water ingress had been experienced within the North-Eastern office of the old church.



Based on our observations of the roof above the North-Eastern office of the old church, we identified multiple locations where, in our opinion, water has been able to ingress into the subject area below which include the following:



Insufficient apron flashing between tiles roof allowing water to penetrating behind the flashing.



Deteriorated sealant and cracked FC sheet parapet cladding and inadequately sealed penetrations through the FC sheeting allowing water to penetrate through the FC sheeting.



Gaps within apron flashing adjacent to the parapet flashing allowing water to penetrating behind the flashing during wind driven rain. 



Gaps between the roof tiles and sheet metal roof flashing allowing water to penetrating within the gap during wind driven rain. 



Unsealed holes within the roof sheeting allowing water to permeate below the roof sheeting.



Deteriorated sealant around roof penetrations allowing water to ingress around the penetrations.

Whether ongoing drainage works to the exterior of the property has caused or contributed to water ingress from storm event 26 July;



In our opinion, the ongoing drainage works during the storm event on 26 July 2020 would have contributed to the water ingress, however was not the underlying cause of water ingress during the subject storm."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following storm damage was noted:

Resultant Damage to Cottage Structure

Uplifted Roof Sheets



From the Insured’s provided advice, a section of the roof sheets had been dislodged and uplifted to the nearby storage shed area due to the experienced heavy storm. Image 3



We understood that the roof structure has been underway with an ongoing renovation including the replacement of roof framework and roof sheets at the time of storm event.



At the time of our inspection, we noted the missing roof sheets had been replaced by Insured during the current construction works. Image 4



In our opinion, the cause of failure is due to the insufficient number of tie-down fixings during the incomplete renovation process.



In our opinion, given the unfinished state of roof renovation during the storm, the roof had not had the required uplift capacity to withstand the heavy wind load during the subject storm event.



Damaged Window Panes



We confirm that we inspected three (3) damaged window panes within the dwelling front elevation. Image 5 & 6



From Insured’s account, the storm had caused debris from the construction material stored in front of the cottage building to blown off and damage the existing window panes along the front elevation.



As such, impact damage glass panes require to be removed and replaced to match existing.



Resultant Damage to Hay Shed Structure



The subject Hay Shed structure is estimated to be no less than fifty (50) years old.



At the time of our inspection, we noted a section of the shed roof, including the roof sheeting, timber battens and rafters have been dislodged, due to the subject storm event. Image 7 & 8



From our inspection, we noted significant evidence of deterioration, wet rot and termite damages to the roof timber framework. Image 9



Moreover, the existing roof sheeting appeared to be in an unsatisfactory condition with evidence of surface corrosion throughout.



In our opinion, the observed damages to the shed roof have resulted from the long-term deterioration of the roof framework (including roof timber battens & rafters), and the tie-down connections which inevitable failure has only triggered by the experienced storm event.



Notwithstanding the above, we advise that the current construction of the subject roof framework does not meet the current requirements of the current Australian Standards and NCC BCA 2019 in providing a warrantable repair.



However, this report has been prepared to assist the cash settlement for the observed resultant damages due to the claimed storm event only and does not include the required upgrading works to the roof framework in accordance with the relevant Australian Standards, NCC BCA 2019 and Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) requirements.



In addition to the above, we noted one (1) of the existing timber posts have been subsided into the ground, which has caused noticeable deflection to the adjoining timber framework. Image 10



 However, from the Insured’s account, we understood that the subsided timber post is a pre-existing issue, and as such, it has been excluded from this \claim.



Resultant Damage to Timber Walkway

The construction of the walkway structure consists of timber posts supporting a timber-framed metal sheet roof. Image 11



Posts measured to be approximately 100mm x 100mm embedded into the ground. Image 12



The timber posts are in an extensively dilapidated condition with signs of wet rot, splitting and termite damage evidence throughout the walkway. Image 13 & 14



In our opinion, this has caused a  continual reduction in post’s capacity, particularly about the base connection.



In our opinion, the observed damage is consistent with the failure of posts about the base due to reduction of the post capacity, which ultimately and inevitably failed subject to the wind load during the storm event.

Damaged Rural Fencing



According to the provided report prepared by (TBS), a tree has collapsed and damaged the existing rural boundary fence. Image 15



However, the damaged section of the fence has been removed and replaced by the Insured prior to our inspection.



Damaged Light Post 



We noted damage to the existing timber light pole with top dome fallen off due to the storm event, requiring removal and replacement inclusive of necessary electrical wiring and fixings to match the existing. Image 16



Damaged Concrete Blockwork 



We noted movement and rotation to the three (3) top courses of concrete blocks within the existing blockwork corresponding to the southern-eastern alignment of the main residence/cottage structure.



As such, allow for readjustment and reinstallation of the dislocated concrete blocks to match the existing. Image 17",NA,"Cottage Structure

From the Insured’s provided advice, a section of the roof sheets had been dislodged and uplifted during the experienced storm event. 



At the time of our inspection, the missing roof sheets had been replaced prior to our inspection by Insured during the current construction works. 



In our opinion, the cause of failure is due to the insufficient number of tie-down fixings during the incomplete renovation process.



Further to the above, we noted three (3) damaged window panes within the dwelling front elevation, which require removal and replacement to match the existing. 



From the Insured’s account, the storm had caused debris from the construction material stored in front of the cottage building to blown off and damaging the window panes.

Hay Shed Structure

We noted a section of the shed roof, including the roof sheeting, timber battens and rafters had dislodged, due to the subject storm event. 



In our opinion, the observed damages to the shed roof have resulted from the long-term deterioration of the roof framework (including roof timber battens & rafters), and the tie-down connections which subsequently failed due to the experienced storm event.



We advise that the current construction of the subject roof framework does not meet the current requirements of the Australian Standards and NCC BCA 2019 in providing a warrantable repair.



However, this report has been prepared to assist the cash settlement for the observed resultant damages due to the claimed storm event only and does not include the required upgrading works to the roof framework in accordance with the relevant Australian Standards, NCC BCA 2019 and Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) requirements.

 

Timber Walkway

From our inspection, we noted significant evidence of wet rot, splitting and termite damage to the timber posts throughout the whole surface. 



In our opinion, this has caused a long-term reduction in post’s capacity, particularly about the base connection.



In our opinion, the observed damage is resulted from the failure of posts about the base due to reduction of the post’s capacity, which ultimately and inevitably failed subject to the heavy wind during the storm event.

"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property to which the following was noted:

Overall s

The subject building is essentially a pseudo portal framed shed which has been predominantly enclosed along the perimeters with the exception of southern side providing access for storage of machineries and parts.



The building in general is in dilapidated and decrepit state with widespread deteriorated building elements and members including but not limited to steel post and beams, timber roof purlins and in particular corroded roof sheets about the western side of the building.



The eastern part of the building roof has been cladded with asbestos corrugated roof sheeting where a number of roof sheets are missing along with flashing and ridge capping.



The aforementioned building also accommodates an office building on the eastern end of the building which has been covered under the same building envelope with asbestos roof sheeting; however, the office wall claddings and elevations are in a better maintained condition.



The following diagram has been provided in clarifying the locations and extent of roof cladding types for reporting and referencing purposes:





Figure 2 – Site View with Reference to Extent of Roof Cladding Types

Roof Cladding

Metal Roof Portion and Cladding



From our drone survey, sections of roof metal cladding including ridge capping are missing with one piece of detached roof sheet was still resting over the roof. Images 2 & 3



We also noted a section of polycarbonate roof sheet was missing. 



The remainder of ridge capping is in corroded state with some parts are detached from the roof sheets.



Evidence of poorly installed roof sheet patch repairs using varying length and colour of sheets was noted that have been carried previously in an attempt to maintain the building envelope weatherproofing. Image 4



From internal inspection within the shed, we noted significant corrosion of the metal roof sheets generally along the laps and joints where in area has effectively resulted in loss of metal material. Images 5 to 9



Along the aforementioned corroded and missing roof sheets, we noted deflection and deterioration within the timber roof purlins and beams was noted consistent with long-term exposure to water and elements. Images 10 & 11



Asbestos Roof Portion and Cladding



Sections of the asbestos roof sheets along with ridge capping have been detached and removed from the roof. Images 12 to 14



Evidence of previous patch repairs to the polycarbonate roof sheet was noted. Image 14



From internal inspection within the shed, we noted evidence of corrosion over the steel members including roof beam and columns considering the exposure to moisture and elements over years post construction in the absence of maintenance. Image 15



We noted deflection, warping and deterioration within the timber roof purlins in areas away from the removed section of the asbestos roof cladding which is consistent with long-term exposure to water and elements. Image 16







Building Elevations



The fascia beams along the southern side of the roof are in dilapidated state with one particular fascia beam was partially left in collapsed state. Images 17 to 20



The eaves gutters along the southern side are predominately is missing and the remainders are in heavily corroded state and risk of collapse. Images 17 to 20



The eaves gutters along the northern side are similarly in a dilapidated condition with parts missing and remainder in corroded state and evidence of shrubs and vegetations growing within the gutters. Images 21 to 23



Evidence of movement and deterioration across the walls claddings in varying states was noted consistent with general wear and tear and absence of maintenance. 



The section of shed about the western end of the building had been removed with southern and northern wall along with the raised timber flooring were left in place. Images 24 & 25



We noted in removing the western end of the building, the western end of the shed has been temporarily enclosed by installation of timber wall girts and cladding.



Review of Historical Aerial Imagery

In determining the on-going condition of the subject building, we have undertaken comprehensive review of historical Nearmap imagery of the subject building to which we provide the following table to summarise the condition (refer to Appendix A) of the subject building relative to image date.

Additional two (2) sections of the asbestos roof sheeting has been detached and removed.

21 June 2021

Removed section of asbestos roof can be seen left unattended since 2014 along with the debris which is discoloured.

This is indicative of absence of maintenance and upkeep of the roof.



Review of Historical Google StreetView Imagery

In determining the on-going condition of the subject building, we have also undertaken review of historical Google StreetView imagery of the subject building along the northern elevation to which we provide the following table to summarise the condition (refer to Appendix B) of the subject building relative to image date.

Based on our review of historical Nearmap and Google Streetview imageries, it is clear that the subject building has been subject to on-going damage and deterioration without effective and proper maintenance of the building.



 In the absence of effective and proper maintenance of the building, various elements of the building and in particular the roof cladding has progressively been damaged over time in years and continually exacerbated to the current dilapidated state.



On the above basis, in our opinion, the claimed damage to the roof cladding and other elements of the building has inevitably exacerbated during the claimed storm event due to its already compromised integrity of the roof cladding materials.







Review of the Wind Activity

In ascertaining the magnitude of the experienced wind gust during the claimed storm activity on 29 October 2021, we have reviewed climate data from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). Appendix C



The obtained data is taken from the BOM website for the Laverton weather station, which is approximately 4.1km from the subject property. 



From our review, we note that the maximum wind gust which occurred on 29 October 2021 was 102 km/h, occurring from the west (W) direction. 



We advise that the experienced wind gust of 102 km/h is equivalent to a speed of 28.33 m/s.



With reference to the oldest version of Australian Standards for wind loading being AS CA34 Part II – 1971 Wind Forces, the basic regional wind speed that structures should have been designed as a minimum was specified as 87mile/hr (140km/hr or 38.9m/s). refer to Appendix D.



On the above basis, given that the maximum recorded wind gust of 102 km/h is lower than the minimum design wind speed, in our opinion, the claimed heavy wind activity on 29 October 2021 would not have solely caused the claimed damage if the building was in a maintained condition.



Value at Risk Assessment



In line with your instructions, we have prepared an estimated Sum Insured (SI) for the reconstruction of the subject building inclusive of demolition limited to the building as highlighted in Figure 1.



We qualify that are provided estimate of the Sum Insured (SI) is an estimate only and has been prepared by using Rawlinson’s Construction Handbook 2021 applications.



Our generated cost estimate for the reconstruction of the property has been based on the following assumptions and parameters:



SWP Prices used in the comparative estimate have been derived from industry rates, assessment and judgement.



Rebuilding of the building has been estimated by the use of gross floor area (GFA) comparable to an industrial factory structure with external framed walls, sheet metal roof and basic amenities on a like-for-like basis.



Calculations completed on the basis of 1850m2 gross floor area (GFA) of the building. 



Includes Builders Margin, Consultant Fees, Council or Authority Costs.



COVID-19 adjustment index to account for shortage of material and labour –  6%



The demolition of the subject property has been estimated $222, 000.00 inclusive of GST inclusive of a rate of $120 per sqm applied at the above mentioned GFA.



The reconstruction cost of the entire building has been estimated in the vicinity of $1, 323, 675.00 inclusive of GST inclusive of a rate of $715.50 per sqm applied at the above mentioned GFA.



In our opinion, the total Sum Insured value (SI) of the building totals a reconstruction cost of approximately $1, 545, 675.00 inclusive of GST.",NA,"Cause of Damage

From our inspection, we advise that the building in general is in dilapidated and decrepit state with widespread deteriorated building elements and members as detailed within the body of this report.



From our inspections and assessment of the historical aerial and street view imageries, evidently various elements of the building and in particular the roof cladding has progressively been damaged over time in years and continually exacerbated to the current dilapidated state.



On the above basis, in our opinion, the claimed damage to the roof cladding and other elements of the building has inevitably exacerbated during the claimed storm event due to its already compromised integrity of the roof cladding materials.



From our assessment of the recorded wind gust on 29 October 2021 against the oldest Australian Standards for wind loading being AS CA34 Part II – 1971, we confirm that the recorded wind gust of 102km/hr is 27% lower than the specified wind speed of 140km/hr.


To this end, in our opinion, the claimed heavy wind activity on 29 October 2021 would not have solely caused the claimed damage if the building was in a maintained condition and therefore, the cause of damage is due to age, wear and tear in the absence of maintenance and upkeep of the building.

Value At Risk Assessment

From our estimation, the total Sum Insured value (SI) of the building totals a reconstruction cost of approximately $1, 545, 675.00 inclusive of GST."
", Comments &","Photos Attached As Appendix



Inspection was undertaken at the subject property to which the following storm damage was noted:



We have undertaken a drone survey of the roof surfaces within the subject Church in ascertaining the extent of damage to the roof cladding. Image 2



According to our drone survey, we noted evidence of damage to the section of roof cladding, ridge capping and barge capping corresponding to the southwest alignment of the upper roof consistent with the subject storm event. Image 3



At the time of our inspection, the detached section of roofing had been reinstated to its original position and remained in place.



In our opinion, the aforementioned affected roof elements will require partial removal and reinstatement inclusive of all associated flashing, fixings and connections in accordance with AS 1562.1:2018 Design and Installation of Sheet Roof and Wall Cladding and NCC BCA 2019 requirements.



We further inspected the adjacent lower roof surfaces to which no sign of damage or storm-crated opening was noted. 



Moreover, we noted a number of cracked and loose brick units about the top course along the roof edge, which can be repaid by localised removal and reinstatement. Image 4



In addition, we noted cracking to a number of brick units corresponding to the wall rebate in close proximity to the area of concern. We note that the observed cracking is consistent with cyclic expansion growth of the brick units and unrelated to the subject storm event. 



However, we note that the above-mentioned damage has no demeaning effect on the overall structural integrity of the supporting brick wall.



We note that from provided advice and our assessment, given the raked nature of the ceiling there is no access or limited access to the roof cavity to assess the roof framework.



As such, at the time of our inspection, we were unable to visually inspect the roof timber framework and the associated tie-down connections.







Having said that, in our opinion, the proximate cause of the observed damage to the roof is attributable to inadequate tie-down connections of the roof rafters to the supporting brickwork to resist the wind loading at the time of the event, which has resulted in roof uplift and localised damage to the brick units as outlined previously.



We note that the removal of the damaged roof sheet upon reinstatement works will allow for re-assessment of the roof framework, to which further investigation in ascertaining the roof integrity can be undertaken by a qualified carpenter.



In saying that, should the existing framework exhibit any sign of damage, the damaged members to be removed and replaced in accordance with AS 1684.2 – Residential Timber-Framed Construction.  



According to our visual inspection from the internal ground level, we noted minor movement and separation of the ceiling timber mouldings from the brickwork about either side of the southwestern brick wall. Images 5 - 7



However, no evidence of major movement within the ceiling timber boards was noted to suggest that the roof framework has been compromised or there is an imminent risk of collapse. 



In our opinion, given the raked nature of the ceiling, the ceiling timber panels are directly affixed to the roof main framework, and as such, the experienced uplift to the roof cladding has translated to the ceiling, causing the observed movement and separation from brickwork.



Further to the above, we noted damage to the existing downpipe servicing the lower roof along the southwest elevation, requiring reinstatement to match the existing size and profile inclusive of reconnection back to the existing stormwater system in accordance with AS 3500.3:2021 - Plumbing and Drainage. Image 8","Identified damage to roofing elements, particularly about the southwest alignment of the upper roof, as detailed within the body of this report is consistent with the experienced storm event, which can be partially removed and replaced in accordance with the current relative Australian Standards and NCC BCA 2019 requirements.



From our drone inspection, no evidence of damage or distress to the supporting brickwork apart from a number of loose and cracked brick units about the top course was noted to suggest the overall structural integrity of the building has been compromised.

"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property to which the following tree impact damage was noted:



In schematically illustrating the damaged areas affected by the water ingress, we have provided schematic floor plans of the subject property, highlighting the elements and areas of sustained water damage. – Refer to Appendix A 

Observed Damage



From our inspection of the internal areas, we noted the following water damage:



Upper Level (Entry)



Water staining to the bulkhead plasterboard lining corresponding to the corner of the fixed window within the Living. Image 2



Middle Level



We noted water damage to the floorboards and ceiling lining corresponding to the southwest corner of the Dining. From provided information, water ingress was reported from the glass pane about the existing steel beam protruding the glass pane, supporting the upper balcony. Images 3 - 6

Lower Level



Water ingress damage to the section of carpet overlay along the balcony sliding door within Bedrooms 1 & 2. Images 14 - 18



Water ingress damage to the section of carpet overlay directly below the window opening within Bedroom 3. Images 19 & 20



Basement Level



Water ingress into the Basement area from the junction of the retaining wall/floor against the retained backfill. Images 21 & 22



Assessment of Water Ingress & Damage



In ascertaining the cause of water ingress and damage, we undertook inspection and assessment of various internal and external areas throughout the property inclusive of balconies to which we have attributed the underlying cause to the following issues:



Defective Flashing Between Wall & Fixed Window



From our review of the provided Leak Detection Report, subsequent to the completed spray testing, the source of water ingress has been attributed to separation between flashing and window frame.



In our opinion, the above finding is consistent with the mechanism and pattern of observed water ingress damage to the bulkhead lining directly below the fixed window about upper (entry) level.



In our opinion, during a high-intensity rainfall, the identified separation between flashing and window frame will enable the wind-driven rain to permeate into the internal areas and result in the observed water damage.



Considering the above, in our opinion, the cause of water ingress damage to the bulkhead lining within the upper level is due to the defective flashing and unrelated to any single insurable event.





Defective Silicone Sealant About Steel Beam Penetration



With reference to the Leak Detection Report, the spray testing of the area above within the balcony, identified water ingress around the existing steel beam penetration within the glass panes.



The aforementioned steel beam is supporting the edge of the above balcony.



 From our inspection, we noted the balcony above consists of a tiled section and timber deck extension about the free edges.



We noted evidence of pre-existing and long-term localised water staining to the steel beam top flange directly about the penetration into glass panes. 



In our opinion, during rainfall, water can permeate through the inherent gap between the above balcony tiling and timber decking and onto the steel beam flange.



In saying that, water is able to gradually track laterally through the steel flange due to water capillary action and pool against the sealant around the steel beam penetration within glass panes. 



We note that external silicone is always susceptible to deterioration from cyclic environmental, weather and thermal exposure over time, and requires ongoing maintenance and reapplication over time.



In saying this, any breaches or perforations along the sealant facilitate entry points for water ingress to occur during rainfall over time. 



As such, in our opinion, subject to defective and deteriorated sealant application around the steel beam, water can permeate into the internal areas as identified through spray testing.

 

In our opinion, the cause of water ingress is attributed to the defective or deteriorated sealant application around the steel beam penetration, which is an inherent maintenance issue and unrelated to any single insurable event.



Omission of Hob/Step-Down and Waterstop Angle at Balcony Doors



From our inspection of the balconies about the middle and lower levels, we noted no evidence of adequate step-down or hob between the internal and external areas. Images 22 - 29



In saying this, the internal finished floor level is relatively continuous with the balcony finished floor level. 



Moreover, no sign of evidence of an internal waterstop angle about the balcony door sill was noted.



Furthermore, we noted evidence of cracked and deteriorated silicone sealant application along the sill of door openings.



Inherently, external silicone is always susceptible to deterioration from cyclic environmental, weather and thermal exposure over time, to which its effectiveness is dependent on ongoing maintenance and reapplication over time.



In saying this, any breaches or perforations along the sealant facilitate entry points for water ingress to occur during rainfall over time. 



We refer to AS4654.2:2012 – Waterproofing Membrane Systems for Exterior Use – Above Ground Level – Part 2: Design and Installation which requires a set-down to provide a vertical surface as a physical barrier against water ingress into the building inclusive of a sub-sill flashing.



In addition, without the installation of a waterstop angle, effective vertical termination of waterproofing measures within the internal floor face cannot be met adequately.



A typical detail of waterproofing at external door openings illustrating the above-noted construction requirements has been provided in Figure 2, taken from AS 4654.2:2012.  







Figure 2 – Typical Waterproofing Membrane Detail at External Door Openings



We note that during heavy storm events, directional rainfall can pool against the balcony door sill.



Consequently, in absence of the abovementioned waterproofing provisions, in our opinion, water is able to gradually track laterally from the balconies and penetrated through the inherent gaps along the door sill and into the internal areas as observed in the middle-level balcony doors and lower-level bedrooms 1 & 2.



Consequently, in absence of the abovementioned waterproofing provisions, in our opinion, water is able to gradually track laterally from the balconies and penetrated through the inherent gaps along the door sill and seep down into the internal areas below as observed in the middle-level ceiling lining adjacent to the manhole panel.



In remediating the inherent construction defect, in our opinion, it is unfeasible and impractical to introduce a step-down within the balcony at this stage. 



As a practical alternative, in our opinion, a new strip drain system and downpipe should be retrofitted within the balconies along the sliding doors to mitigate future water ingress into the internal areas.  



The abovementioned remedial solution will require the engagement of a qualified Hydraulic Engineer to provide a compliant design for sizing of the abovementioned strip drain and downpipe, in accordance with NCC BCA 2019 and AS3500.3 – Stormwater Drainage. 



In addition, we advise for installation of waterstop angle about the internal face of the balcony door opening.





Defective Window Sill Flashing



From our external inspection of the existing window opening about Bedroom 3 on the lower-level, we noted several windows do not possess any weepholes along the brick course below the window opening to suggest that adequate sub-sill flashing has been installed. Image 30



We further sighted that the external brickwork window sill does not provide any fall away from the building.



In accordance with Master Builders Australia Waterproofing Guides Book 4 – Flashing and Damp-Proof Courses, window sills should be sloped at least 15 degrees away from the window to facilitate the drainage of rainwater.



A schematic cross-section diagram taken from the abovementioned documentation has been provided within Figure 3.







Figure 3 – Typical Window Sill Detail



Given the inadequate window sill slope, water is able to pond along the window sill during rainfall.



In saying that, any defective or non-existence window sill flashing can allow water to subsequently seep underneath the window frame and within the brickwork cavity.



Given the absence of weep holes and effective sill and cavity flashing as shown in Figure 3 above, water can track down and pool about the wall and flooring junction.



Consequently, during a prolonged heavy rain event as occasioned the area, the trapped water can result in moisture being absorbed by internal brick skin through capillary suction.



In our opinion, the observed water ingress about the Bedroom 3 is consistent with inherent construction issues as outlined above and is not a direct result of the claimed storm or any other single insurable events.













Inherent Subterranean Water Ingress into Basement



From our inspection of the basement, we noted water ingress occurring mainly about the base of the masonry retaining walls along the front elevation.



Given that the basement area is considered a non-habitable area, we envisage that no waterproofing provisions have been provided behind the retaining wall to mitigate subterranean water ingress from the retained backfill.



We note that the waterproofing of the masonry retaining wall at the time of original construction was not a requirement of AS 4654.2 and NCC BCA given that the patio space was considered a non-habitable external area.



Naturally occurring and flowing sub-surface and subterranean water will be present at all times and during high-intensity rainfall periods saturating the backfill material behind the basement retaining walls.



On the assumption that the waterproofing membrane had been provided behind the retaining walls, given the considerable age of the property, we envisage that any waterproofing provisions that had been present would have exceeded the typical 10-15 year lifespan of such products, to which deterioration of the membrane enables subterranean moisture to bypass.



Considering the above, given the inherent underground construction of the basement, rising damp and subterranean moisture migration through the porous masonry walls will always be expected to occur over time.



In saying that, in our opinion, the above-mentioned issue would always be expected to occur.



In mitigating such moisture ingress, we recommend the installation of a negative waterproofing membrane on the internal faces of the perimeter walls.



However, in our opinion, such remedial works cannot be completely warranted and are only for the alleviation of such damage, given the partial underground construction and inherent susceptibility to moisture ingress.",NA,"From our inspection and assessment, we consider the experienced water ingress throughout the

property to be attributable to a combination of the following issues:



Defective flashing between Wall & fixed window frame about the upper level, allows wind-driven rainfall to permeate through the exhibited separation and casing the observed damage to the bulkhead lining below.



Defective silicone sealant around the steel beam penetration within glass panes about the corner of middle level Living, which facilitates entry points for water ingress to occur during rainfall over time.



Omission of a hob/step-down and internal waterstop angle between the balconies and adjacent internal areas, to accommodate for the vertical termination of the waterproofing membrane and act as a physical barrier to water entry. In absence of such, water is able to track across the balcony sliding door tracks into the internal areas or seep down into the internal areas below.  



The absence of effective window sub-sill flashing and inadequate window sill slope, resulted in water pond against the window sill and ultimately seeping down into the wall cavity and pool about the wall/flooring junction and thereby causing the observed damage within Bedroom 3.



Inherent subterranean moisture ingress through perimeter retaining walls of the basement, given its underground construction.



To this end, in our opinion, the underlying cause of water ingress and damage throughout the

property is attributable to a combination of inherent construction issues and long-term

deterioration, and is not a direct result of the claimed storm or any other single insurable

event."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following tree impact damage was noted:



We have provided Figure 2 below, a schematic floor plan of the subject property, highlighting the areas and elements sustained tree impact damage.

The provided dimensions are indicative only and to be confirmed on-site.



Extent of Tree Impact Damage -  External Areas



Damaged Roof Tiles and Roof Framework (Western Alignment)



We noted localised damage to the exiting roof ties corresponding to the direct point of tree impact, requiring removal and reinstatement to match exiting. Should match to existing be not feasible, provisional allowance to be provided for removal and replacement of the entire roof tiles within the western alignment to achieve a uniform look as much as practicable.



We noted damage to the roof sarking corresponding to the point of direct tree impact, which requires removal and replacement within the western alignment of the roof up to the roof ridge.



In saying that, the existing undamaged roof tiles within the western alignment of the roof are also warranting to be temporarily removed, stored and reinstated in facilitating the installation of a new sarking membrane.



We also noted localised damage to a number of roof rafters and battens over Bedroom 1, requiring removal and replacement in accordance with AS 1684 – Residential Timber-Framed Construction. Image 2



Given our limited view of the roof cavity, we were unable to identify the exact extent of damage to the roof framework.



However; from our inspection, no evidence of excessive deflection of movement to the eastern alignment of the roof was noted to suggest the integrity of the roof framework has been compromised.



As such, we recommend further investigation to be undertaken during the rectification works to assure the integrity of the roof framework has not been affected due to tree impact.



Moreover, we noted damage to the eaves gutter about the point of tree impact. As such, the entire eaves gutter along the western alignment of the roof requires removal and reinstatement to match the exiting profile and configuration in line with the relevant Australian Standards.



Bedroom 1 Boxed Window



We inspected evidence of damage to the roof sheet and fascia board and eaves gutter along the Bedroom 1 boxed window, consistent with tree impact damage. Images 3 & 4



Consequently, the entire roof sheet together with the fascia board and eaves guttering to be removed and reinstated to match exiting.



Damaged Western Alignment Eaves Lining



We noted evidence of damage to the eaves lining corresponding to the western elevation of the Living area, consistent with tree impact damage, requiring partial removal and reinstatement to match existing. Image 4



We also observed cracking to the eaves lining along the junction to the Boxed Window roof framework, consistent with impact damage, requiring removal and replacement, to match exiting.



Damaged Walkway Balustrade



We further noted evidence of damage to the existing balustrade running along the timber walkway about the western side of the main residence. Image 5



In our opinion, the noted damage is consistent with subject tree impact damage and requires complete removal and reinstatement to match exiting.



In our opinion, the extent of damage is only limited to the balustrade and the overall integrity of the walkway structure has not been compromised.



Subfloor 



Further to the above, we undertook the inspection of the subfloor area. Images 6 & 7



The existing flooring framing is consisting of timber joists and bearers supported off the isolated stumps.



From our inspection, no cracking, movement or distress to the flooring and stumps was noted suggesting the structural integrity of the sub-floor area has been compromised.






Extent of Tree Impact Damage -  Internal Areas

Bedroom 1



Within Bedroom 1 we noted the following damage consistent with the subject tree impact damage: 



Images 8 – 14



We noted evidence of damage to the ceiling, requiring removal and reinstatement to match existing.



We noted damage to the ceiling framework, requiring removal and replacement to match existing.



We noted water ingress damage to the wall lining corresponding to the northern side of the bedroom as a result of water permeating during the storm event.



We further noted cracking to the wall lining propagating from the bottom left corner of the window opening, requiring patch and repair.



We noted cracking to the wall lining along the ceiling junction within the B.I.W about the bedroom, consistent with damage due to vibration force induced by the subject tree impact event.



Living Area



We observed localised damage to the ceiling lining with evidence of a tree branch punched through the lining corresponding to the southwest corner of the Living area. Image 15



We also note signs of water stain damage to the ceiling lining within the southwest corner of the Living area consistent with water ingress during the subject storm event. Image 16



As such, the damaged portion of the ceiling lining will warrant removal and reinstatement to match the existing. Refer to Figure 2 for the approximate extent of the damage.













Miscellaneous Damage Consistent with Tree Impact 



We noted evidence of damage to the exiting satellite antenna/dish local to the direct point of impact, requiring removal and reinstatement. Image 17



 Moreover, we noted damage to the exiting lights affixed within the eaves lining along the western alignment, requiring removal and reinstatement to match exiting.",NA,"Identified external and internal damage detailed within the body of this report is consistent with the experienced tree impact or subsequent water ingress damage during the storm event due to the compromised roof.



At the time of our inspection, we are unable to determine the extent of damage to the roof framework due to the enclosed raked ceiling configuration. 



However, from our inspection, no evidence of excessive deflection of movement to the eastern alignment of the roof was noted to suggest the integrity of the roof framework has been compromised.



As such, we recommend further investigation to be undertaken during the rectification works to assure the integrity of the roof framework has not been affected due to tree impact.



In addition, we undertook the inspection of the subfloor area, to which no evidence of cracking, movement or distress to the flooring and stumps was noted suggesting the structural integrity of the sub-floor area has been compromised.



Considering the foregoing, in our opinion, the overall structural integrity of the building has not been compromised apart from the localised damage as identified within this Report, which can be repair and reinstated."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property to which the following was noted:

Observed Damage

Roof



From our aerial drone inspection, we noted that the collapsed tree had directly impacted the lower sections above the Garage and Bedroom 5 and the upper roof section above the Master Bedroom Walk-In-Robe (W.I.R). 



In saying this, damage has been sustained to sections of the timber roof framework, corrugated metal roof sheeting, guttering and downpipes, fascia boards and soffit lining which will all require removal and replacement. Images 2 & 3



Furthermore, we noted damage to air-conditioning unit and whirlybird on the lower roof, requiring removal and replacement. Image 4



On the upper roof, we noted damage to the solar pool heating system, requiring removal and replacement. Image 5



We noted no visual evidence of damage to the solar panels, however, we advise that a suitably qualified contractor will be required to undertake inspection, testing and certification.



Garage



Within the Garage, we noted a section of the timber wall framework about the south-western corner had been damaged by the tree impact, requiring removal and replacement inclusive of attached internal and external linings. Image 6



Similarly, the damaged section of timber roof framework and ceiling lining will also require removal and replacement. Image 7



From our observations, we noted no visual evidence of cracking, distress or movement to the external masonry walls to indicate that damage has occurred from the tree impact. Image 8



Bedroom 5



Within Bedroom 5, we noted water damage and swelling to the joinery within the built-in-robe (B.I.R). Images 9 & 10



We further noted blistering paint around the roof beam and plasterboard linings directly above. Image 11



In our opinion, the pattern and location of damage is consistent with water ingress through the exposed roof section as a result of the tree impact event, requiring reinstatement.



Bedroom 5 Ensuite



Within the Bedroom 5 Ensuite, we noted evidence of blistering paint and water staining to the plasterboard ceiling lining.



In our opinion, the pattern and location of damage is consistent with water ingress through the exposed roof section as a result of the tree impact event, requiring reinstatement. Images 12 & 13



Master Bedroom Walk-In-Robe



Within the Master Bedroom W.I.R, we noted water staining to the plasterboard ceiling lining. Image 14



the pattern and location of damage is consistent with water ingress through the exposed roof section as a result of the tree impact event, requiring reinstatement.

Make-Safe Works

From our inspection and assessment, in our opinion, the property is not currently at risk of imminent collapse.



However, in further mitigating risk of damage and water ingress, we advise that the following make-safe works should be administered immediately:



Installation of temporary propping to the damaged roof framework section within the Garage.



Installation of weatherproof tarpaulin over the exposed section of wall/roof within the Garage, inclusive of adequate tie-down provisions.



Installation of weatherproof tarpaulin over the exposed section of roof over the Master Bedroom W.I.R, inclusive of adequate tie-down provisions.



Removal of all tree debris from the roof.

Further Damage Claimed by Insured

At the time of our inspection, the Insured had indicated further various areas of damage to which they opine had occurred as a result of the experienced tree impact.



In illustrating the locations of claimed damage, annotated floor plans have been provided in Appendix A.



Item 1 – Entry Pavers



The Insured has that claimed cracking along the grout joint within the external entry pavers has occurred as a result of the experienced tree impact event. Image 15



From our observations, we noted that the pavers had been installed directly abutting the external walls of the dwelling.



In accordance with AS 3727.1:2016 – Residential pavements, isolation joints should be provided where a pavement adjoins a building or other rigid structure.



In absence of the above, the differential thermal expansion between the abutting building materials has induced cracking into the brittle grout joint over time.



Item 2 – Rear Sandstone Steps



The Insured has claimed that the rear entry sandstone steps have shifted as a result of the experienced tree impact event. Image 16



Given the significant distance away from the location of impact, in our opinion, such movement is not consistent with the experienced tree collapse.



In our opinion, given the absence of any positive connection between the sandstone steps and adjoining deck structure, the steps act as an independent element which is susceptible to movement from external influence such as foot traffic and over time.



Item 3 – Entry Hallway Ceiling Lining



The Insured has claimed that cracking has occurred to the plasterboard ceiling lining within the Entry Hallway, about the base of the staircase, as a result of the experienced tree impact event. Image 17



We noted that the hairline crack has occurred along the butt joint between adjacent plasterboard sheets, in proximity to the change in direction of the sheet layout.



With reference to the Gyprock - The Red Book/USG Boral Plasterboard Installation Manual 2016/Gyprock Residential Installation Guide, expansion (control) joints should be installed at changes in direction within the plasterboard sheet layout to accommodate for movement or alterations in ambient conditions. 



In absence of such control joint provisions, differential thermal movement between the plasterboard sheets has induced cracking along the weak planes over time.



Notwithstanding the above, given the absence of cracking within Bedroom 5 which is in closer proximity to the tree impact location, the claimed cracking damage is not consistent with the tree collapse event.



Item 4 – Lounge/Kitchen Ceiling Lining



The Insured has claimed that cracking has occurred to the plasterboard ceiling lining within the Lounge and Kitchen as a result of the experienced tree impact event. Images 18 – 21



From our inspection, we noted that the claimed cracking has occurred along the apex of the vaulted plasterboard ceiling, including the junction of the roof rafters.



Given the vaulted configuration of the ceiling, we advise that the apex is inherently a location of high stress concentration, to which cracking and movement will always be expected to occur.



Notwithstanding the above, given the consistent pattern of considerable distance away from the location of impact, such movement is not consistent with the experienced tree collapse event.









Item 5 – Family Room Bi-Fold Doors



The Insured has claimed that the bi-fold doors within the Family Room have jammed as a result of the experienced tree impact event. Image 22



Notwithstanding the considerable distance away from the location of impact, we noted no evidence of cracking, distress or movement to the surrounding floor, walls or ceiling to indicate that the door framework has been adversely affected by the tree collapse.



Given the considerable span of the door opening, in our opinion, long-term deflection of the lintel would be expected to have occurred, to which the smooth operation of the door has been progressively compromised over time.



Item 6 – First Floor Deck



The Insured has claimed that cracking to the First Floor Deck soffit lining has occurred as a result of the experienced tree impact event, occurring around the steel post penetration. Image 23



Moreover, the Insured has claimed that the southern roof beam has sustained movement as a result of the experienced tree impact event, to which minor gaps are evident between the beam and surrounding timber moulding. Image 24



In our opinion, the observed cracking and movement appear consistent with differential thermal movement between the abutting building materials which is expected from cyclic and seasonal changes in temperatures over time, in absence of any gaps or expansion joint provisions.



Notwithstanding the above, we noted evidence of debris build up within and over the cracks which is indicative of pre-existing and aged origin.



On the basis of the above, in our opinion, the claimed movement is unrelated to the tree impact or any other insurable event.



To this end, in our opinion, the abovementioned areas of damage claimed by the Insured are attributable to inherent building issues and are unrelated to the tree impact or any other insurable event.



Notwithstanding the above, we advise that the claimed damage is not demeaning to the structural integrity of the property and can each be locally repaired accordingly.",NA,"Observed Damage

From our inspection and assessment, we advise that the following building elements have sustained damage as a result of the tree impact event:



Roof

Corrugated metal roof sheeting

Air-conditioning unit (Lower Roof)

Whirlybird (Lower Roof)

Eaves guttering and downpipe

Fascia boards

Solar pool heating system (Upper Roof) (Solar panels will require inspection, testing and certification by a suitably qualified contractor)

Further Damage Claimed by Insured

At the time of our inspection, the Insured had indicated further various areas of damage to which they opine had occurred as a result of the experienced tree impact.



We provide the following table which outlines our assessment and qualifications of the claimed damage.



Claimed Damage

Proximate Causation

Related to Tree Impact or Any Other Insurable Event?

Cracking along the grout joint within the external entry pavers

Omission of isolation joint between pavers and abutting structure, to which cracking has been induced onto the brittle grout joint through differential thermal movement.

No

Movement to rear entry sandstone steps

In absence of any positive connection between the sandstone steps and adjoining deck structure, the steps act as an independent element which is susceptible to movement from external influence such as foot traffic and over time.

No

Hairline cracking to plasterboard ceiling lining within Entry Hallway, occurring along the butt joint between adjacent plasterboard sheets

With reference to the Gyprock - The Red Book/USG Boral Plasterboard Installation Manual 2016/Gyprock Residential Installation Guide, expansion (control) joints should be installed at changes in direction within the plasterboard sheet layout to accommodate for movement or alterations in ambient conditions. 

In absence of such control joint provisions, differential thermal movement between the plasterboard sheets has induced cracking along the weak planes over time.

No

Cracking along the apex of the vaulted plasterboard ceiling lining, including at the junction of the roof rafters

Given the vaulted configuration of the ceiling, we advise that the apex is inherently a location of high stress concentration, to which cracking and movement will always be expected to occur.



No

Jammed bi-fold doors within Family Room

Given the considerable span of the door opening, in our opinion, long-term deflection of the lintel would be expected to have occurred, to which the smooth operation of the door has been progressively compromised over time.

No

Cracking to the soffit lining around the steel post penetration on the First Floor Deck and minor gaps between the timber roof beam and surrounding moulding

The observed cracking and movement appear consistent with differential thermal movement between the abutting building materials which is expected from cyclic and seasonal changes in temperatures over time, in absence of any gaps or expansion joint provisions.



Notwithstanding the above, we noted evidence of debris build up within and over the cracks which is indicative of pre-existing and aged origin.

No



Furthermore, given the considerable distances away from the location of impact, as highlighted in Appendix A, such claimed damage is not consistent with the experienced tree collapse event.



To this end, in our opinion, the abovementioned areas of damage claimed by the Insured are attributable to inherent building issues and are unrelated to the tree impact or any other insurable event.



Notwithstanding the above, we advise that the claimed damage is not demeaning to the structural integrity of the property and can each be locally repaired accordingly."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following tree impact damage was noted:



A roof plan of the subject property illustrating the damaged areas affected by the collapsed tree, along with typical fixing details of timber framework has been provided as Appendix A.



External Damage



The tree impact location is approximately about the south-western portion of the dwelling. 



At the time of our inspection, the collapsed tree had been removed.



Roof Sheet, Guttering and Fascia Board

		

We noted roof sheeting at the south-western portion of the roof has been damaged from the tree impact, requiring removal and replacement. Image 2-5. 



In addition, we noted roof capping and flashing about the south-western portion of the roof has been damaged from the tree impact, requiring removal and replacement. Image 4.


Furthermore, we noted damage to the guttering and fascia board about the southern elevation of the subject property, requiring removal and replacement. Image 5-7.



Boundary Fence

		

We noted the wooden boundary fence at the back portion of the dwelling has been damaged from the tree impact, requiring removal and replacement. Image 12. 


Eaves Soffit Lining



We noted eaves soffit lining along the Southern elevation of the building has been damaged from the tree impact requiring removal and replacement. Image 8-9

Internal Damage



Roof Framework

 

We noted roof truss framing at the south-western portion of the roof has been damaged from the tree impact, requiring removal and replacement. Image 8.



We also noted roof battens at the south-western portion of the roof has been damaged from the tree impact, requiring removal and replacement. Image 8. 



We have provided a typical section with fixing details of timber roof and ceiling framework inclusive of tie-down specification and roof truss splicing details within Appendix A.



Ceiling Lining

		

Furthermore, we noted ceiling lining within the alfresco has been damaged from the tree impact, requiring removal and replacement. Image 10 & 11.",NA,"Identified damage detailed within the body of this report is consistent with the experienced tree impact. 



At this stage, no compliance issue in accordance with NCC Building Code of Australia (BCA) 2016 was noted or identified."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following tree impact damage was noted:



We have provided Figure 2 below, schematic floor plan of the subject Horse Stable building, highlighting the elements and areas sustained tree impact damage.







Figure 2 – Schematic Floor Plan of the Subject Horse Stable Building





From our inspection, we noted damage to the following building elements, which has occurred as a result of experienced tree impact.

Roof Cladding 

From our inspection, we noted the section of roof cladding corresponding to the southeast corner of the Horse Stable building (about the direct point of impact) has collapsed, which had already been removed from the site. Images 3 - 5



Moreover, we noted the roof sheeting along the eastern alignment and northeast corner of the Horse Stable building as highlighted in Figure 2 has sustained significant tree impact damage. Images 3 - 5



Moreover, we noted the remaining section of the roof sheeting to be generally in an aged and dilapidated condition consistent with general wear and tear over a prolonged period of time and unrelated to the tree impact.



In saying that, in our opinion, the existing roof sheeting has surpassed its service life, and requires complete removal and replacement in accordance with AS 1562.1 requirements.



As such, to achieve a warrantable repair, we advise for complete removal and replacement of the existing roof sheeting with a new Colorbond roof cladding, inclusive of all associated flashing and safety mesh in accordance with AS 1562.1 - Design and Installation of Sheet Roof and Wall Cladding and manufacturer’s specifications.



In proportioning the extent of resultant tree impact damage to the roof sheeting, we estimate approximately 45% (110 m2 GFA) of the total roof area (245 m2 GFA) has sustained damage as a direct result of tree impact.  



In undertaking the above, an application for a Development Application or Complying Development Certificate (CDC) will be required for the roof reconstruction works, in view of obtaining Development Consent (DC) and subsequent Construction Certificate (CC).

Roof Timber Framework 

From our inspection, we noted significant damage to a number of roof timber rafters and battens along the eastern alignment of the roof framework consistent with tree impact damage. Images 6 - 12



Generally, we noted evidence of rot and deterioration of the roof timber members, which is consistent with expected long-term environmental degradation. 

In our opinion, such deterioration has developed over an extended period of time and has resulted in the progressive decrease of the structural integrity and capacity of the timber members.



Furthermore, according to our assessment, we identified numerous non-compliance issues with the roof tie-down provisions against current Australian Building Codes and Standards, which is consistent with the age of the building.



In saying that, in our opinion, in achieving a warrantable repair and to assure long-term serviceability of the roof framework, we recommend the entire roof timber framework will require removal and upgrades to achieve compliance with current relevant Australian building codes and standards.



Having said that, we estimated that approximately 10% of the total roof framework has been damaged as a result of the claimed tree impact, as such, in our opinion, the cost of resultant damage repairs equates to only 10% of the total cost should the Insured wishes to replace the entire roof framework.

Gutters and Fascia

We noted tree impact damage to the eaves gutters and fascia boards and eaves around the location of impact. Images 13 - 15



From our inspection, we noted that the remaining eaves gutters and fascia boards are in dilapidated condition due to long-term wear and tear and lack of regular upkeep. 



Moreover, we were unable to identify any downpipe within the entire length of eaves gutters.



In saying this, in providing a warrantable repair, we recommend complete removal and replacement of the abovementioned building elements inclusive of new downpipes in accordance with AS 3500.3 and NCC BCA 2019 requirements.



We noted that the extent of resultant tree impact damage within the aforesaid building elements is estimated to be approximately 20Lms.

External Brickwork 

According to our inspection, we note the existing brickwork about the immediate point of tree impact corresponding to the southeast corner of the Horse Stable building has been significantly damaged, requiring removal and replacement in accordance with AS 4773 – Masonry in Small Buildings. Refer to Figure 2 for the extent of damage within the brickwork. Images 16 & 17



Based on our assessment, in our opinion, the extent of damage to the brickwork is only contained to the immediate point of impact and the remaining brickwork appeared to be unaffected as a result of the tree impact. Images 18 & 19

Electrical Services 

We noted tree impact damage to the exiting floodlight affixed to the brickwork within the mid-section of the eastern alignment, which requires removal and replacement inclusive of all associated wiring, fixings and connections to match the existing.

Comments and Discussion

Roof Cladding

We noted tree significant tree impact damage to the roof sheeting corresponding to the northeast, eastern and southeast alignment of the Horse Stable building.



From our inspection, the remaining section of the roof sheeting was noted to be in aged and dilapidated condition due to general wear and tear over a prolonged period of time.



In saying that, to achieve a warrantable repair, we recommend for complete removal and replacement of the roof sheeting within the entire roof surface in accordance with AS 1562.1 and manufacturer’s specifications.



In proportioning the extent of resultant tree impact damage to the roof sheeting, we estimate approximately 45% (110 m2 GFA) of the total roof area (245 m2 GFA) has sustained damage as a direct result of tree impact.  



Such works will require application for DA/CDC in view of obtaining Development Consent (DC) and subsequent Construction Certificate (CC).



Roof Timbre Framework

Based on our observation, we noted number of roof timber battens and rafters within the eastern alignment of the roof have sustained tree impact damage, beyond repair and require removal and replacement.



From our inspection of the undamaged section of the roof framework, we noted evidence of rot and deterioration of the roof timber members, which is consistent with expected long-term environmental degradation.



Moreover, we a noted number of non-compliance issues with regard to roof tie-down provisions relative to current Codes and Standards requirements.



Subsequently, in our opinion, in providing a warrantable repair, we advise for the entire roof timber framework to be removed and replaced inclusive of necessary tie-down upgrades to achieve compliance with current relevant Australian building codes and standards.



Having said that, we estimated that approximately 10% of the total roof framework has been damaged as a direct result of the claimed tree impact.



Gutters and Fascia

We noted tree impact damage to the eaves gutters and fascia boards and eaves around the location of impact. 



We further noted that the remaining eaves gutters and fascia boards are in dilapidated condition due to long-term wear and tear and lack of regular upkeep.



We were unable to identify any downpipe within the entire length of eaves gutters.



Considering the above, in our opinion, the above building elements will warrant complete removal and replacement in line with relevant Australian Standards and NCC BCA 2019 requirements in providing a warrantable repair.



In our opinion, approximately 20Lms of the total eaves guttering and fascia board has been damaged as a result of claimed tree impact.



External Brickwork 

The existing brick walls corresponding to the direct point of tree impact about the southeast corner have sustained significant tree impact damage, which requires complete removal and replacement in accordance with AS 4773.

We noted tree impact damage to the exiting floodlight affixed to the brickwork within the mid-section of the eastern alignment, which requires removal and replacement inclusive of all associated wiring, fixings and connections to match the existing."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following vehicle impact damage was noted:



We noted the brick wall about rear of the subject garage has been completely damaged as a result of direct vehicle impact. Images 2-9



The subject brick wall appeared to be single brick with engaged piers measured approximately 1200mm spacing.



We noted the brick wall is extended from footing approximately 700mm below garage finished floor level up to the roof eave gutter. 



In addition, we noted the garage roof is timber truss frame system supported off timber transfer beam about the rear area.



We noted the timber transfer beam is supported off brick engaged piers at both ends. Image 11



At the time of our inspection, we did not note any sign of structural deflection and distress within timber roof frame and transfer beam to indicate structural integrity of the roof framing system has been compromised due to the vehicle impact. As such, in our opinion, the timber roof frame structure can remain in place. Images 10-11



It appears that the top chord of the truss roof has spanned over the abovementioned brick wall about the rear of the garage to support fascia board without any physical fixing into the wall. Images 10-13.



In saying that, the subject brick wall along the rear of the garage is working as cantilevered or freestanding wall without any lateral support and restrain on top.



Further to the above, we noted localised damage within the edge of the concrete slab along the north-eastern alignment of the garage, requiring patch and repair.



We also noted the downpipe about the rear of garage has shifted as a result of the vehicle impact. Image 6



We noted damage within external brick wall about the north-western corner of the garage consistent with vehicle impact damage. Image 7.




Review of the Structural Compliance of the Garage Wall about Rear Alignment  

As mentioned above, the brick wall in question is unreinforced single brick wall with engaged piers at approximate 1200mm centers spacing with total high of approximate 2700mm.



We refer to AS4773.1:2015 – Masonry in Small Buildings, table 9.2, we noted external unreinforced single leaf brick wall with engaged piers to have minimum 600mm pier spacing to be deemed to satisfy the standard’s requirements. 



Figure 2- Excerpt Pier Spacing Requirement within AS4773.1:2015 



However, we noted the engaged pier spacing of the subject brick wall about the rear of the garage is 1200mm.



As such, we confirm the single leaf brick wall with engaged piers about the rear of the garage is not in compliance with the requirements of AS4773.1:2015.



In saying that, the damaged brick wall about the rear of the garage is to be replaced using 230mm double brick wall



A timber top plate of 90x45mm is to be installed on top of the brick wall using metal strap, in which top chord of the roof frame can fix into using triple L grip.",NA,"We confirm damages specified within the report is consistent with the vehicle impact damage. 



At the time of our inspection, we did not note any sign of structural deflection and distress within timber roof frame and transfer beam to indicate structural integrity of the roof framing system has been compromised due to the vehicle impact. 



As such, in our opinion, the timber roof frame structure can remain in place.



In addition, we confirm the single leaf brick wall with engaged piers about the rear of the garage is not in compliance with the requirements of AS4773.1:2015.



Subject to the above, we provide the following construction methodology in facilitating reinstatement of the damaged brick wall:



Install adequate propping to support the timber roof frame prior to any demolition and reinstatement of the brick wall.



Patch existing concrete slab using Sika MonoTop -412 NFG in accordance with Sika specifications. 



Allow seven (7) days after the application of Sika Monotop-412 NFG prior to construction of the brick wall about rear of the garage.



The subject damaged brick wall at rear of the garage is to be replaced with 230mm thick double brick wall inclusive of “toothing” provision to allow new brickwork to key into the existing brickwork inclusive of ties (heavy-duty wall ties at every three (3) courses) and flashings in accordance with AS 4773.2-2010 – Masonry in Small Buildings – Construction.



Install 90x45 MGP10 top plate is to be placed over the subject brick wall and tied down with metal strap at 900mm centres in to the wall.



Top chord of the existing truss roof frame is to be fixed to the timber top plate using one (1) triple-L-grip in accordance with AS1684.2.

No transition flashing was noted between the attached carport and the tiled roof of the main dwelling. Images 10-11



From our inspection, we confirm that the subject carport has been poorly constructed, not complying with NCC BCA 2019 and relevant Australia Standards. 



As such, in order to provide warrantable repairs, we advise that the entire carport is to be removed and replaced; as such, a structural engineer is to be engaged to redesign the subject carport in accordance with the NCC BCA 2019 and current Australian Standards.

External Area



We noted three (3) of scaffold steel posts about the front section of the carport have been damaged and rotated as a result of the subject vehicle impact. Images 2-5



However, no evidence of lateral displacement was identified within the entire carport structure (only localised movement to the damaged posts at front of the carport); as such the remaining steel posts can remain in place. Images 2-5



Damage to the roof framework about the front section of the carport inclusive of Trimdek metal roof sheeting, timber roof beams, barge board and purlins was noted, consistent with the experience vehicle impact. Images 6-8



We observed that the eaves gutter and downpipe about the eastern alignment of the carport has been damaged, consistent with the experience vehicle impact. Image 9



Damage to the hip roof capping tiles about the south eastern alignment of the dwelling adjacent to the carport area was identified, consistent with the vibration from the occurred vehicle impact. Images 10-11



We also noted the hip roof capping tiles about the south western corner of the property has been damaged; however, given the location of the subject defect, in our opinion, it should be considered as pre-existing and inconsistent with the subject vehicle impact. Image 12



Localised damage to the corner of the Pebblecrete slab within the porch area was noted, consistent with the experienced vehicle impact. Images 4-5



No other external damage to the main dwelling inclusive of, eaves soffit lining and weatherboard cladding was identified. Images 4-7



At the time of our inspection, we were unable to inspect the roof framework of the main dwelling adjacent to the carport area (direct vehicle impact location); however, no distress or movement within the eaves soffit lining was noted to suggest any structural damage to the roof framework of the main dwelling. Image 7



Displacement, damage and rotation within the left-hand side leaf of the steel entry gate was identified, consistent with the occurred vehicle impact. Image 13

Internal Area



Crack damage to the ceiling lining and skirting within the living room was noted, consistent with the vibration from the experienced vehicle impact. Image 15



We also noted the architrave about the entry door has been damaged, consistent with the vibration from the experienced vehicle impact. Images 16-17",NA,"Identified damage detailed within the body of this report is consistent with the experienced vehicle impact.



Furthermore, in our opinion, only the front section of the garage has been displaced and rotated as a result of the direct vehicle impact; however, given the carport structure has been attached to the main dwelling, the imposed force from the vehicle impact has been dissipated by the main dwelling structure which prevented the displacement of the entire carport structure."
", Comments and","Photos Attached as Appendix



Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following was noted:



In schematically illustrating the location of impact about the subject property, we provide    Figure 2 below:

External Damage

Images 2 - 9



We noted cracking and chipping of concrete slab in the corner of the South-Western face of the building about the driveway, consistent with the vehicle impact event. Images 2 – 9



We did not identify any excessive movement, cracking and damage from the vehicle impact to the adjacent external areas.



We noted pre-existing hairline cracking about the concrete slab unrelated to the impact.



In our opinion, the observed cracking is insignificant to compromise the structural integrity of the property.



As such, we opine that, the observed cracking can be repaired and is not structurally demeaning to the subject property.

Internal Damage

Images 10 - 32



In addition to the internal areas at the adjacent corner location of the vehicle impact, we inspected office rooms 2 and 3 about the Western elevation of the subject property. 



From our observation, we noted pre-existing hairline cracking and evident patch repair in the Room 1 adjacent to the impacted external area. Images 14 - 16



We consider the damage and cracking consistent with long term and ongoing general building movement.



We further noted, pre-existing issues of moisture permeation within the internal areas.     Images 20 - 21



Similarly, we noted cracking on the corner of the wall propagating from the window about the Office Room 2 and 3 at the other side of the sustained vehicle impact.



We opine that, these areas are locations of high stress concentrations and are susceptible to cracking from general building and thermal movement over time and age-related wear & tear/ deterioration.



Having said that, no signs of excessive movement, distress and cracking were noted about the internal areas to suggest that the damage occurred due to vehicle impact.



In our opinion, if such vehicle force did not cause damage to the direct corresponding room, then it is absolutely unlikely that any transfer of force caused any movement or cracking to the adjoining areas.



As such, we consider that the vehicle impact force was minimal in both significance and magnitude to cause internal damage to the corresponding rooms internal fit-out.



On the above basis, on-going and cyclic foundation reactivity causes ground movement and settlement to occur and ultimately result in the experienced building movement as observed in the internal areas. 



Noting the above, we confirm the cause of the observed cracking damage to the internal areas and external areas except for the localized area of the above-mentioned vehicle impact is attributable to long-term general building movement due to thermal contraction/ expansion and inherent maintenance issues within the subject property and is unrelated to the vehicle impact event.



As such, we opine that the cracking and chipping of concrete due to the vehicle impact is superficial, localized to the external area only and has not impacted internal areas and is not structurally demeaning to the subject property.","Confirm if superficial damages only



From the observation and assessment of the subject property, we opine that the structural integrity of the concrete slab and the adjacent areas (internally and externally) has not been compromised due to the occurred vehicle impact.



To this end, we opine that the damage sustained by the concrete slab due to vehicle impact is superficial and is not structural demeaning to the subject property.



Recommendations

In providing recommendations for repair on a “without prejudice” basis, we advise the following actions should be considered:



Reinstatement works



Reinstate the chipped concrete slab using high strength cementitious mortar in accordance with the manufacturer’s specification to match existing finish. Approximately 1.0 m2.



Allow for the preparation and application of three (3) coats of external acrylic paint to the affected area to match existing colour. 1 off - Approximately 1.0 m2

"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the building manager and maintenance manager to which the following damage was noted:

Basement 

It has been advised by the building manager that water ingress within the lowest basement level has been an ongoing problem for approximately three (3) years. Images 2 – 3



It has also been advised that water has been penetrating through the slab ground in the basement. Image 4



In facilitating the cause of the observed water ingress Figure 2 has been provided below. 





Figure 2: Cause of Water Ingress within the Basement

In our opinion, water ingress within the basement is a result of blocked subsoil drainage or the omission of subsoil drainage which has allowed water to build up against the concrete wall resulting in water to penetrate through the wall and slab on ground. 



In our opinion, the water ingress is a result of inherent building defects and is unrelated to the construction works on the neighbouring property or any other insurable event. 

Southern Elevation

We noted the following damage to the render on the southern façade:



Cracking and missing render at the slab edge and adjacent to slab edge. Images 5 – 8

Vertical and horizontal cracking in render. Images 9 – 10  

Diagonal cracking propagating from the bottom of windows in the middle of the Southern façade. Images 11 – 12 

Cracking along vertical expansion joints. Image 13 – 14 

Missing render around pipe penetrations. Images 15 – 16

Localised missing render on brickwork. Image 17 – 18 

Blistering and degradation of paint. Images 19 – 20



The majority of the damage to the render was at the slab edge which, in our opinion, is a result of long-term differential movement between the slab and wall resulting in cracking and delamination of render, in representing this effect Figure 3 has been provided below.





Figure 3: Cracking in Render at Slab Edge Due to Differential Movement

The observed vertical and horizontal cracking in render, in our opinion, is a result of thermal movement and shrinkage due to insufficient number and spacing of expansion joints in the render.



In our opinion, the observed diagonal cracking below windows is a result of long-term differential settlement within the subject building occurring over an extended period of time in years causing cracking to occur below the openings which has consequently caused the render to crack and delaminate.



The observed cracking along vertical expansion joints is expected due to thermal movement in the render.



Furthermore, in our opinion, the missing render around pipe penetrations is a result of movement in the pipe causing render around the pipe to crack and delaminate.



In our opinion, the localised cracking in render is a result of long-term degradation of render causing sections of render to become drummy and delaminate.



Finally, in our opinion, the blistering and degradation of paint is a result of water penetrating behind the render from cracks in the render (refer to Figure 3 above) and long-term sun exposure of the render.

		

It has been advised by the building manager of the subject property that works have been undertaken since the dilapidation report to remove drummy render on the Southern façade.



As a result, we are not able to provide a true and accurate comparison of the current and pre-construction condition of the Southern façade based on the photos provided in the MAJ dilapidation report.



Notwithstanding the above, we have provided photos from the dilapidation of the pre-construction condition of the external southern façade attached as Appendix A.



With prejudice, the defects and damages outlined in the dilapidation indicates that there are inherent building issues that predate the construction with the render.



As such, in our opinion, removed delaminated render would have been delaminated prior to the construction of the neighbouring property.




Furthermore, a visual indicator of cracking due to vibration from construction is diagonal cracks propagating from openings within the external walls that reduce in severity in relation to the height, in illustrating this effect Figure 4 has been provided below.





Figure 4: Typical Crack Patterns in Render Caused by Vibration



Based on our inspection we did not observe any damages that are consistent with vibration or impacts caused from the neighbouring construction site.



As such, in our opinion, the observed damage to render predates the construction of the neighbouring building and is unrelated to the construction works on the neighbouring property or any other insurable event. 



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, render will continue to delaminate over time due to inherent building issues with the external render. 






Northern Elevation

We noted the following damage to the render on the southern façade:



Cracking and missing render at the slab edge and adjacent to slab edge. Images 21 – 22

Vertical and horizontal cracking in render. Images 23 – 24 

Diagonal cracking propagating from the bottom of windows in the middle of the Northern façade. Images 25 – 26

Cracking along vertical expansion joints. Image 27 – 28

Missing render around pipe penetrations. Image 29 -30 

Localised missing render on brickwork. Image 31

Blistering and degradation of paint. Image 32



It has been advised by the building manager that damage to the render on the northern façade of the subject property had worsened since the start of the neighbouring construction.



Since there was not a dilapidation survey undertaken prior to the commencement of construction works we are not able to compare the condition of the façade prior to and after the neighbouring construction works. 



However, considering that the Northern façade is approximately 35m away from the construction site, as shown in Figure 5, it is likely that is was not a requirement due to the northern façade being outside of the “zone of influence” which is typically 20-30m away from a construction site and is unlikely to be affected by the construction.

Figure 5: Distance of Northern Façade from the Construction Site

It has been advised by the building manager of the subject property that works have been undertaken since the start of the neighbouring construction to remove delaminated and drummy render on the Northern façade.



The majority of the damage to the render was at the slab edge which, in our opinion, is a result of long-term differential movement between the slab and wall resulting in cracking and delamination of render, in representing this effect Figure 3 has been provided above.



The observed vertical and horizontal cracking in render, in our opinion, is a result of thermal movement and shrinkage due to insufficient number and spacing of expansion joints in the render.



In our opinion, the observed diagonal cracking below windows is a result of long-term differential settlement within the subject building occurring over an extended period of time in years causing cracking to occur below the openings which has consequently caused the render to crack and delaminate.



The observed cracking along vertical expansion joints is expected due to thermal movement in the render.



Furthermore, in our opinion, the missing render around pipe penetrations is a result of movement in the pipe causing render around the pipe to crack and delaminate.



In our opinion, the localised cracking in render is a result of long-term degradation of render causing sections of render to become drummy and delaminate.



Finally, in our opinion, the blistering and degradation of paint is a result of water penetrating behind the render from cracks in the render (refer to Figure 3 above) and long-term sun exposure of the render.



Based on our inspection we did not observe any damages that are consistent with vibration or impacts caused from the neighbouring construction site, as outlined in Figure 4 above.



As such, in our opinion, the observed damage to render predates the construction of the neighbouring building and is unrelated to the construction works on the neighbouring property or any other insurable event. 



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, render will continue to delaminate over time due to inherent building issues with the external render. 



Roof

It had been advised by the building manager that repairs to cracks and painting to the roof parapet render had already been undertaken within the past 2-3 weeks. Images 33 – 35 



As a result, we are not able to provide an accurate and true comparison of the current and pre-construction condition of the roof parapet based on the photos provided in the MAJ dilapidation report as no cracks were visible.



To this end, we are unable to categorically determine if any damages has been sustained to the roof parapet due to the repairs already undertaken at the time of the inspection, however, considering that external render damage is considered not to be attributed to the neighbouring construction, in our opinion, the condition of the roof parapet would have remained unchanged from the condition prior to the neighbouring construction.

Stormwater Riser (Level 16)



It had been advised by the building manager that a stormwater pipe had broken on level 16 during the construction on the neighbouring property. Image 36



In general, vibration caused from construction would cause issues to arise on lower levels due to higher energy within the lower levels. 



In saying this it is unlikely that vibration would cause an isolated pipe approximately mid height on the structure to break without affecting pipes on lower levels.



To this end, considering this is an isolated event located only on level 16, in our opinion, the broken stormwater pipe is attributed to inherent building defects that predate the neighbouring construction and is unrelated to the neighbouring construction or any other insurable event.

Render within Units

It has been advised by the building manager that cracking has occurred within a number of units which has been claimed to be caused by the neighbouring construction.



It is understood that the building manager is putting together a report of cracking in units that is reported as being a result of the neighbouring construction.



However, the original dilapidation report produced by MAJ did not record the condition of any units within the subject property. 



At the time of the inspection we only inspected Unit 17 & Unit 114.



Unit 17



We noted a vertical crack approximately 1mm in width within the render of the loungeroom wall for the entire height of the wall. Images 37 – 38 



It has been advised by the owner of Unit 17 that they moved into the subject unit approximately three (3) years ago and that the crack was existing at time of occupancy, however it is claimed that the crack has increased in size since occupying the subject unit.



In our opinion, the observed vertical crack is consistent with thermal movement and shrinkage within the render causing the observed crack and is a result of the omission of movement joints within the render.



Furthermore, cracks widen over seasonal changes, and in our opinion, is the cause of the visual changes to the width as claimed by the owner of the unit.



We also noted diagonal cracking propagating from the window within the render. Image 39



In our opinion, the observed cracking is a result of long-term differential thermal movement within the brickwork under the opening and adjacent to the opening.



Should an expansion joint have been placed at the joint between the brickwork below and adjacent to the window than, in our opinion, the observed cracking would not have occurred.



In our opinion, the observed render cracking within Unit 17 is attributed to inherent building defects that predate the neighbouring construction and is unrelated to the neighbouring construction or any other insurable event.



Unit 114 – Balcony



We noted the following damage to the render on the Unit 114 Balcony:



Missing render & cracking at the slab edge and adjacent to slab edge. Images 40 – 41

Vertical and horizontal cracking in render. Images 42

Localised removed drummy render. Image 43 – 44 

Concrete cancer & exposed reinforcing. Image 45

Cracking along vertical expansion joints. Image 46

Vertical cracking in balcony edge upturn render. Image 47 – 49 

Blistering and degradation of paint. Images 50 – 51

It has been advised by the building manager of the subject property that works have been undertaken since the start of the neighbouring construction to repair drummy render. Images 52 – 54 



Damage to the render at the slab edge, in our opinion, is a result of long-term differential movement between the slab and wall resulting in cracking and delamination of render, in representing this effect Figure 3 has been provided above.



The observed vertical and horizontal cracking in render, in our opinion, is a result of thermal movement and shrinkage due to insufficient number and spacing of expansion joints in the render.



In our opinion, the localised removal of drummy render is a result of long-term degradation of render causing sections of render to become drummy and delaminate.



Furthermore, in our opinion, the observed concrete cancer and exposed reinforced is a result of insufficient cover to the reinforcement at the time of construction and is an inherent building defect, which has also subsequently caused render to crack and delaminate. 



The observed cracking along vertical expansion joints is expected due to thermal movement in the render.



Vertical cracking observed on the balcony upturn render is, in our opinion, a result of inadequate spacings of expansion joints within the render to allow for thermal movement and shrinkage which has consequently resulted in the observed render cracks.



Finally, in our opinion, the blistering and degradation of paint is a result water penetrating behind the render from cracks in the render (refer to Figure 3) and long-term sun exposure of the render.



Based on our inspection we did not observe any damages that are consistent with vibration or impacts caused from the neighbouring construction site.



To this end, in our opinion, the observed damages to render within the balcony area of Unit 114 is attributed to inherent building defects that predate the neighbouring construction and is unrelated to the neighbouring construction or any other insurable event.



Notwithstanding the above, in our opinion, render will continue to delaminate over time due to inherent building issues with the external render.",NA,"During our inspection, the building manager of the subject property expressed concerns over a number of issues that are claimed to be as a result of the construction of the neighbouring property.



In providing a summary of the observed damages and the causes of the damages we have provided the table below.

Generally, damages caused by vibration from a neighbouring building site will produce crack patterns where cracking is more severe at lower levels and less severe as height increases.



However, we did not observe any damages that are consistent with that caused by vibration from a construction site. 



Furthermore, render has been removed from the facades of the subject building and a true and accurate comparison cannot be made with the pre-construction condition as outlined in the MAJ dilapidation report.



To this end, we were not able to identify any damages to the subject property that were a result of the neighbouring construction or any other insurable event."
"Inspection of the residential property was undertaken to which the following was noted:



Entry Staircase

 

Cracking and separation between the stairs leading to the entry door and the abutting wall was noted. Images 2 – 4



No evidence of flexible joint between the concrete stairs and abutting brick wall was noted to accommodate the differential movement between the two (2) different material namely concrete and brick.



As such, in the absence of such flexible sealant along the junction of concrete stairs and abutting brick wall, crack and separation as observed will propagate over time due to general building and differential thermal movements.





Living Room



Eastern Wall



Cracking within the Eastern wall and cornice propagating from the window opening facing the construction works was noted. Image 6



Evidence of previous attempts in repair of the plaster render crack propagating from the window opening along the aforementioned crack was noted suggesting the pre-existing origin of such crack.



Southern Wall and Timber Flooring



Visual evidence of uplift and cupping within the timber flooring was noted propagated about the middle of the living room in line with the southern window.



On the Southern window, a gap between the sliding panel and window framing was noted. Images 7 & 8



From the Insured’s provided advice, water ingress has occurred through the aforementioned gap within the window as a result of a blockage and overflowing of the eaves gutter above which has subsequently caused ingress of water into the living room resulting in water damage and cupping of the timber Living Room flooring as observed. Image 9 



From observation, no evidence of cracking within the hardset plaster render around the window was noted. Image 10





Kitchen



Vertical cracking within the wall tiles and tile mortar joints about the south east and south western corner of the kitchen was noted. Images 12 – 13



About the south eastern corner of the kitchen, dislodgment of the wall tiles from the substrate was also noted.





Bar Area



Movement within the timber bar cabinetry panel and timber wall panel above was noted. Image 15





Second Floor Bathroom



Vertical cracking at the base of the toilet suite was noted. Image 17



Horizontal cracking within the ceramic tiles underneath the bathtub hob was noted. Image 18



Cracking within wall ceramic tiles underneath the window within the tile mortar joint at the wall corner along the southern wall alignment and was noted. Images 19 & 20



Evidence of previous attempt in sealing the vertical crack at the wall corner above the bathtub was noted suggesting the pre-existing origin of such crack.





Second Floor Terrace



Vertical cracking to the external brickwork about the north eastern corner of the bedroom adjacent to the sliding door was noted. Image 21 – 23



No visual evidence of vertical articulation joint within the brickwork was noted.



With reference to Australian Standard AS 4773.1 - Masonry in Small Buildings, articulation joints are to be used in masonry construction to reduce cracking or distress of masonry caused by contraction or expansion of the masonry units, or by footing movement or other structural movement. 



AS 4773.1 specifies articulation joints shall be provided in masonry walls in accordance with the following locations: 



Where openings more than 900 × 900 mm occur, at not more than 5 metres centres. 



At a distance from all corners not greater than 4.5 metres and not less than 230 mm for veneer walls. 



I confirm the abovementioned articulation joint requirements have not been completed within the external brickwork of this building. 



In our opinion, the location, pattern and mechanism of the observed cracking within external brickwork are consistent with expansion of brickwork relative to omission of vertical articulation joint provisions within the building at time of original build.





Second Floor Hallway



Cracking within the Hallway ceiling plasterboard lining was noted propagating along the plasterboard sheet butt joint and at the change of direction in plasterboard sheet layout. Image 24



I noted that no provision for any expansion joints within the ceiling lining throughout the dwelling have been installed.



With reference to plasterboard lining installation guidance, expansion (control) joints within ceiling lining should be installed at maximum 12m intervals and at the change of direction in plasterboard sheet layout to accommodate structural movement or alterations in ambient conditions.



As such, in our opinion, this observed damage and similar cracks throughout the dwelling is related to general building movement over time in the absence of expansion joints.",": Ground Vibration Analysis & Damage  



When considering possibilities of vibrations causing damage on buildings and structures, differentiation between 'air-borne' and 'ground' vibrations is critical in assessing causation subject to the following qualifications: 



Air-borne vibrations are those that travel through the air as a consequence of the operation of machinery and other equipment. Whilst these vibrations often cause the rattling of windows and tea cups on shelves, and distress and discomfort to nearby residents, they are typically of high-frequency and low energy.



Ground vibrations are those that travel through the ground as a consequence of heavy equipment [e.g. a large road roller, rock hammers, etc. traversing and I or impacting the ground.



As air-borne vibrations are typically of low energy and high-frequency, they seldom cause building damage; by contrast, because ground vibrations can be of high-energy and low-frequency, ground vibrations can cause damage to buildings if the vibration source is sufficiently close to the building, and of sufficient energy.



In view of the above, any damage caused by vibrations from construction equipment, earth tremors & mining has a particular 'signature', and is usually apparent immediately after the event.



In relation to the particular 'signature' of vibration damage, the following are expected:



The most usual form of vibration damage is diagonal cracking and surface hairline cracks within masonry walls and plaster at stress concentrations around openings and corners as a result of the 'stretching' of the building structure during the ground vibration.



Any 'zig zag' cracks in masonry walls along mortar joints, or tapered gaps at wall joints, are typically related to a loss of structural support underneath a footing i.e. foundation settlement rather than ground vibrations.



Any damage observed to a building weeks I months after a vibration event should not be attributed to ground vibrations because vibration damage is relatively 'immediate'.



In assessing the Insured’s claim, we have adopted an objective approach and referred to scientific and engineering principles in this report. 







Without actual vibration monitoring results, this report aims to assess the possibility of claimed vibration damage to the subject building against a series of conditions, parameters and circumstances of this site using relevant vibration standards and guidelines.



In general, sources of vibration include blasting, demolition, piling, ground treatments (e.g. compaction), construction equipment, tunnelling, road and rail traffic and industrial machinery.



In determining the acceptable ground vibration level for the subject historical building, we refer to Queensland Government Transport & Main Roads May 2013 Technical Note 3 – Measurement of Ground Vibrations and Air blasts, Table 1.







Table 1– Acceptable Levels of Ground Vibration from Blasting Table 1.





From Table 1, the subject property falls within category 2 in this case with an acceptable level of ground vibration of 10mm/sec Particle Velocity (PPV) to cause any superficial damage. 



Although information on the type of machinery used for construction works fronting the subject property has not been provided, we acknowledge that the works involves construction of a track slab for the proposed Light Rail.



For this process, excavators, jackhammers, compactors and other vibrating machinery are typically used.



Typical heavy machinery consists of the following ground vibration level PPV indicated in Table 2, excerpted from a Roads & Maritime Service Project Noise, Construction and Vibration Assessment Plan for Narellan Road Upgrade completed by Renzo Tonin & Associates Pty Ltd in 2013. 





Table 2– Typical Heavy Machineries Ground Vibration Level



From the aerial view in Figure 1, the nearest point of the Insured’s dwelling is approximately 10m away from the subject construction zone.



With reference to Table 2, the expected ground vibration levels for aforementioned machineries at a distance of approximately 10m away from the source of vibration will not reach the ground vibration level of 10mm/sec PPV to cause vibrational damage within the subject dwelling.



With reference to Table 2 and the resulting ground-borne vibration relative to the distance from the source, the observed damage within the Insured’s dwelling is not consistent with ground borne vibrational damage caused as a result of the Sydney Light Rail (SLR) construction works along Anzac Parade.





Review of Dilapidation Report and s on the Cause of Observed Damage



Entry Staircase

 

From review of the photos within the dilapidation report related to the entry staircase, the quality of photos is not suitable to assess the presence of the observed crack and therefore such photos are disregarded in our assessment.



From our vibrational analysis and assessment, the observed damage within entry staircase falls well outside of the influence zone of the ground-borne vibrations from SLR construction works.



In our opinion, the observed damage is pre-existing and is a result of general building and differential thermal movements over time in the absence of adequate flexible sealant between the stairs and wall.



As such, the observed damage within entry staircase is not related to the alleged ground-borne vibration from SLR construction works.





Living Room



From review of the photos within the dilapidation report related to the living room, the quality of photos is not suitable to assess the presence of the observed crack and therefore such photos are disregarded in our assessment.



From our vibrational analysis and assessment, the observed damage within living room falls well outside of the influence zone of the ground-borne vibrations from SLR construction works.



In our opinion, the observed cracking is pre-existing relative to evidence of previous repairs and is not related to the alleged ground-borne vibration from SLR construction works.



In the absence of visual evidence of cracking around the southern window to suggest that the observed gap and movement of the window framing was a result of vibrational activity, in our opinion, the movement and gap within the window sliding panel is not related to the alleged ground-borne vibration from SLR construction works.



On this basis, in our opinion, the cause of water ingress is a result of blockage of the eaves gutter above the window resulting in water damage to the timber flooring in a one-off incident and is unrelated to vibrational activity.





Kitchen



From review of the photos within the dilapidation report related to the kitchen, the quality of photos is not suitable to assess the presence of the observed crack and therefore such photos are disregarded in our assessment.



From our vibrational analysis and assessment, the observed damage within kitchen falls well outside of the influence zone of the ground-borne vibrations from SLR construction works.



In our opinion, the observed pattern of damage is not consistent with vibrational damage but rather, the cracking and damage within the tiles and mortar joints are consistent with general building movement over time. 





Bar Area



From review of the photos within the dilapidation report related to the bar area, movement within the bar joinery panel was noted and therefore such movement is pre-existing in origin and unrelated to construction activities – Refer to Figure 2.





Figure 2 – Imagery Excerpted from the Dilapidation Report (Photo 182)

From our vibrational analysis and assessment, the observed damage within bar area falls well outside of the influence zone of the ground-borne vibrations from SLR construction works.



From our review of dilapidation report and our vibrational assessment, the observed damage within bar area is not related to the alleged ground-borne vibration from SLR construction works.



Second Floor Bathroom



From our vibrational analysis and assessment, the observed damage within the subject bathroom falls well outside of the influence zone of the ground-borne vibrations from SLR construction works.



In our opinion, the pattern and mechanism of observed damage within bathroom is not consistent with vibrational damage but is rather related to general building movement.


In addition, evidence of previous attempt in sealing the vertical crack at the wall corner above the bathtub was noted suggesting the pre-existing origin of such crack.

As such, the observed damage within bathroom is not related to the alleged ground-borne vibration from SLR construction works.



Second Floor Terrace



From our vibrational analysis and assessment, the observed damage within the subject terrace falls well outside of the influence zone of the ground-borne vibrations from SLR construction works.



In our opinion, the location, pattern and mechanism of the observed cracking within external brickwork are consistent with expansion of brickwork relative to omission of vertical articulation joint provisions within the building at time of original build.



As such, the observed damage within terrace is not related to the alleged ground-borne vibration from SLR construction works.



Second Floor Hallway



From our vibrational analysis and assessment, the observed damage within the subject hallway falls well outside of the influence zone of the ground-borne vibrations from SLR construction works.



In our opinion, this observed damage and similar cracks throughout the dwelling is related to general building movement over time in the absence of expansion joints.



As such, the observed damage within hallway is not related to the alleged ground-borne vibration from SLR construction works.





NA","From our vibrational analysis and assessment, the observed damage throughout the subject dwelling falls well outside of the influence zone of the ground-borne vibrations from SLR construction works.



In our opinion, all presented damage by the Insured as detailed within the body of this report is not related to the alleged ground-borne vibration from SLR construction works.



On such basis, we consider the observed damage within the Insured’s dwelling to be inconsistent with ground borne vibrational damage related to the construction works along Anzac Parade.



We note the Insured’s testimony about feeling vibrations and window shaking during the course of the construction works; however, the applied engineering and vibrational data does not support a claim for resulting damage to the building as asserted by the Insured.



In our opinion, the observed crack damage throughout the dwelling is attributable to general building and differential thermal movements occurred over an extended period of time in years.



In our opinion, all presented damage by the Insured is a due to general wear & tear and deterioration relating to maintenance and upkeep."
Site Meeting &,"On the 8th July 2013, a meeting was held on site to discuss and observe alleged damages with the following in attendance:



Mr Les Millist of Structural Reporting Pty Ltd.

Mr Derek Jorgensen of LMI Group (On Behalf of the Insured).

Mr Peter Avnell of Cunningham Lindsey.

Mr George Bejjani of Crawford & Company (On Behalf of the Insurers of 21 Maple Street Lugarno).



s and inspection were held about the cause of damages in particular the following areas of concern:



External



Copping tiles from the dwarf brick wall about the northern boundary and pathway. 

Northern boundary wall and abutting return retaining wall.

External cracking to brickwork of north east corner.

Cracking within concrete stair case tread.

Cracking and settlement within pool rockery and paving.



Internal



Internal cracking to laundry walls and cornices.

Cracking within dining and living room ceiling/cornices.

Cracking within bathroom ceiling and cornice.

Cracking in bedroom & study walls and cornices.

Cracking within garage wall.



Our observations and comments on these areas of concern are as follows:



External



Copping tiles from the dwarf brick wall about the northern boundary and pathway. 



Tiles were evidently missing from the wall which appears attributable to construction traffic traversing about the footpath and subsequently causing the detachment of the tiles.



Northern boundary wall and abutting return retaining wall.



Initial concerns by the Insured and SR were raised by possible undermining of the boundary wall during construction and excavation works as depicted in SR Report Photograph 15.



With the above mentioned concerns, SR and the Insured indicated that due to undermining, alleged cracking within the abutting retaining wall has been caused by associated movement and attachment to the northern wall.



Inspection of the northern wall was completed from the neighbouring side to which I did not view any evidence of substantial cracking, movement or rotation of the wall associated with alleged undermining or vibration.



Two (2) trees are growing out from the base of the northern wall as well as within the wall face itself.



This has been noted in the SR report clause 2.4 and acknowledged as an issue causing long term performance and stability of the wall.



Investigation of the tree roots clearly indicated that the root system has traversed along the back of the abutting return wall both laterally and vertically impacting on the bond of the brickwork over a prolonged period of time.



Cracking about the lateral mortar joint and vertically through the brickwork was observed within the returning retaining wall to which SR had installed screws and tell-tale slides to monitor movement.



At the time of this inspection, no tell-tale plates had cracked indicated any further movement from point of installation.



At the time of this inspection, the Owners of 21 Maple Street had constructed a 230mm thick brick retaining wall founded off the bedrock stratum and backfilled with granular fill to support the footing of the northern brick wall.



In my opinion, the constructed brick wall is satisfactory in capacity to facilitate support of the fill about the northern wall footing which has been constructed off the bedrock stratum.



Furthermore, the abutting return wall is not structurally connected to the northern walls and is independent in formation, therefore is unaffected by any movement and unsupported as a factor in any crack propagation.



Given the above, cracking within the abutting retaining wall appears a resultant of long term tree root pressures and articulation unrelated to any construction undermining.



External cracking to brickwork of north east corner.



Minor hairline cracking was observed emanating from brickwork and mortar consistent with general articulation.



At the time of this inspection, installed tell-tale plates had not cracked indicated any further movement from point of installation.



Cracking within concrete stair case tread.



Minor hairline crack within exposed aggregate finished stair tread consistent with general articulation and age of construction.



Cracking and settlement within pool rockery and paving.



General movement and settlement of pavers and rockery considered unrelated to construction works and a result of age and consolidation. 



Internal



Internal cracking to laundry walls and cornices.



Noted as per SR observations.



Cracking within dining and living room ceiling/cornices.



Noted as per SR observations.



Cracking within bathroom ceiling and cornice.



Cracking noted and cause clearly a building defect through the incorrect use of tile grout to fill between cornice and wall tiles rather than flexible sealant.



Cracking in bedroom & study walls and cornices.



Noted as per SR observations.

Cracking within garage wall.



Noted as per SR observations.







In concluding cause of damage, SR reports in line with the Insured’s allegations that the documented cracking and movement are “a result of heavy ground borne vibration caused by the hydraulic rock excavation equipment and that the dwarf wall capping is damaged by construction traffic”.



It is noted that an initial dilapidation report prior to the commencement of any works was not completed by the Insured or the Owners of 21 Maple Street.



Given no photographic or written evidence of the condition of the building prior to works commencing, it is purely speculative to suggest by general consideration that damage has occurred as a result of vibration through the construction activity alone.



In attempt to verify such conclusion of causation through scientific and engineering basis without actual vibration monitoring results, possible vibration damage has been assessed against conditions, parameters and circumstances of this site and the building using relevant vibration standards and guidelines.





Vibration Criteria for Structural Damage to Buildings



In terms of relevant vibration damage criteria, Australian Standard AS2187.2 which refers to British Standard 7385: Part 2-1993 “Evaluation and measurement for vibration in buildings Part 2” is a definitive standard against which the likelihood of building damage from ground vibration can be assessed.



The standard sets guide values for building vibration based on the lowest vibration levels above which damage has been credibly demonstrated. 



These levels are judged to give a minimum risk of vibration-induced damage, where minimal risk for a named effect is usually taken as a 95% probability of no effect.



Generated vibration from machinery and plant is identified as Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) (mm/s).



PPV is dependent on the following factors which have been considered in our evaluation of potential damage and are assessed against the following factors:



Source and type of the vibration (Energy Level) – In this Case Operation of Hydraulic Hammer and Traversing of Excavator.

Distance from the source.

Ground condition (rock, clay and sand) – In this Case Rock.





Figure 1 Three Contributing Factors in Ground-Borne Vibration Problems



In assessing possible vibration damage in the natural ground condition of bedrock which is prevalent in the area, the following parameters have been explored. 





Source and Type of Vibration (Energy Level) Generated From Hydraulic Hammer Operation



Sources of vibration which are considered in the standard include blasting, demolition, piling, ground treatments (e.g. compaction), construction equipment, tunnelling, road and rail traffic and industrial machinery.



From accounts and provided photographic evidence, the excavator used in constructions works within 21 Maple Street Lugarno was no greater than a 2.0t capacity excavator with hydraulic hammer attachment – Representative Excavator in Figure 2.







Figure 2 Small Excavator (No Greater than 2t Capacity) with Hammer Attachment

Such rock breakers and rock drills can generate relatively high vibration levels at close distances.



Typical ground vibration levels for an excavator with hammer attachment at various distances operating in hard sandstone has been obtained from various noise and vibration case studies  in Table 1 which in similar circumstances endeavour to formulate vibration effects.

With respect to equating produced PPV and building damages, reference is made to Table 2 which is found within AS2187.2 – 2006. 



The guide values transient vibration judged to result in a minimal risk of cosmetic damage to residential buildings and industrial buildings are presented numerically.

15 mm/s at 4 Hz increasing to 20 mm/s at 15 Hz

20 mm/s at 15 Hz increasing to 50 mm/s at 40 Hz and above





BS 7385 states that the guide values in Table 2 relate predominantly to transient vibration which does not give rise to resonant responses in structures, and to low-rise buildings.



On this basis, should vibrational damage have been produced using an excavator, a PPV of no less than 15mm/s would be required to have emanated from the hammering activity.









































Distance from the Source



The distances from the source (excavator with hammer attachment) at the northern boundary wall have been detailed below.

Legend:





	Source of Vibration (2t Excavator with Hydraulic Hammer at Northern Boundary Wall).

A – 	Approximately 8m from Living Room Wall.

B – 	Approximately 2m from Abutting Retaining Wall, External North East Brickwork and Laundry Wall.

C – 	Approximately 12m from Bedrooms and Study.

 

From this detail, distance from the source is less than 5 metres which current PPV values in Table 1 do not model such circumstances.



To establish PPV value at a distance of 2 metres which covers damages allegedly sustained to the abutting retaining wall, external north east brickwork and laundry wall, data has been logged and subsequently graphed to formulate working equation for vibration at this given distance.





Figure 3 Logged Rock Breaker PPV Vibration Levels versus Distance



The derived graph of vibration is an exponential curve that generates an empirical formula of y=2.8522.X- 1.662.



When simulating the equation, a resultant PPV of 0.9mm/s is produced at a given distance of 2 metres from the source.



Given the above outcome and a recognised PPV value of 15mm/s to cause cosmetic damage to building fabric, the source would need to be no less than 0.4 metres.



In this case, the only damage susceptible to vibration would be located at the northern boundary wall; however, this was not supported in my undertaken visual inspection or observations.



To this end, the following vibrational outcomes can be established from reference to the guides and equations:



A minimum distance of 0.4 metres from the source to building fabric would be necessary to propagate a damaging PPV of 15mm/s.



At 2 metres from the source, a PPV of 0.9mm/s has been calculated which is just susceptible (Bassett Acoustics, 2007) to humans and does not pose any cosmetic damage to buildings.



Greater distanced building fabrics contained in laundry, living room, dining room and bedrooms fall well outside of generated PPV values of 15mm/s which would emanate damage.






Assessment of Vibration Impact from Traversing Excavator about Northern Footpath



In discounting cause of vibration from operating hammer alone, possible vibration generation from the traversing excavator has also been reviewed.



The graph below indicates assumed PPV values for such circumstances.



In our case, the value of the PPV generated at a distance of 2 metres is 0.8mm/s.





Figure 4 Vibrations from Typical Construction Operations (New 1986)

As with hammer vibration, traversing vibration of 0.8mm/s does not pose cosmetic damage to the building.","My instructions were to inspect and report on the following:

Please attend and provide us with a report as to the cause of sustained damages to the building.

The following findings are based upon the evidence presented and these should be read in conjunction with the preceding comments in the body of this report:

Proximate Cause & Effect

Damage as a Result of Vibration

In rationalising cause of damage to the building, the Insured and appointed Engineer Structural Reporting Pty Ltd (‘SR’) considers the damage to the building as “a result of heavy ground borne vibration caused by the hydraulic rock excavation equipment and that the dwarf wall capping is damaged by construction traffic”.



The SR conclusion is based on speculative consideration only without the premise or use of scientific or engineering formulation.



Furthermore, damages noted within the SR report have been recorded at time of inspection and not referenced against a pre-construction dilapidation report which would clearly delineate the pre-existing conditions of the building.



Given the benefit of alleged vibration damage, we have undertaken a theoretical review and calculation using guidelines and standards relevant to construction vibration and produced the following outcomes:



The generated source from both the use of hydraulic hammer and excavator traversing about the northern boundary would produce Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) of 0.9mm/s which is well below the AS2187.2 guidelines necessary to emanate any damage to a building.



Possible vibration damage may have occurred at a distance of 0.4m from the excavator hammer to propagate a damaging PPV of 15mm/s which could have occurred at the northern boundary fence; however this was not supported in site observations. 



A pre-construction dilapidation report is not on hand to verify the pre-existence of the alleged damages which would clearly outline origin of damages post construction.



SR installed tell-tale plates did not crack or indicate any movement which is consistent with the vibration calculations presented.



Given the above mentioned, there is no physical or formulated evidence to indicate or support the claim that any damage from the construction activity in 21 Maple Street has caused or initiated any damage to the Insured’s building.



On this basis, alleged damages appear to be pre-existing relative to general movement, articulation and age.



Damage to the Northern Retaining Wall Abutting Return Wall



As indicated in observations, no physical evidence was presented to suggest that the northern wall had moved, cracked or deflected as a result of vibration or undermining during construction activity.



At present, the 230mm thick masonry retaining wall constructed to support the footings of the northern boundary wall is considered structurally acceptable to facilitate such function.



With respect to the cracking within the abutting return wall, crack propagation is clearly a result of long term tree root pressures from the two (2) trees growing beneath and within the wall structure.



The claim by the Insured and SR that the cause of cracking has evolved from the connection of the abutting wall to the northern boundary wall and subsidence is dismissed as a plausible causation given the walls are not connected and are independent in construction.



External Cracking of Brickwork to North Eastern Corner



Minor cracking within brickwork and mortar is clearly a result of general long term articulation and is un-defining to the structure.



Internal Cracking



As indicated in our vibration calculations, damage sustained to the internal cornices and linings are not considered a result of excavation operations.



The cracking to the wall linings and cornices are considered a result of creep and general articulation between differing materials not unusual given age of construction.



Damage is cosmetic in nature and can be easily repaired through flexible sealants and patching prior to repainting.



Sequence of Events



The Insured has concerns with construction activity within 21 Maple Street, particular, vibration at the rear of the property as a result of rock excavation appointed Structural Reporting Pty Ltd (‘SR’) to undertake a Dilapidation Report on the 1st May 2013.

A pre-construction dilapidation report was not undertaken by the Insured or the Owners of 21 Maple Street prior to the works commencing.

SR re-attended the property on the 15th May 2013 further to allegations that additional damage had propagated as a result of the construction activity to which SR recorded further areas of damage and installed crack monitoring devices such as engineering screws and tell-tale glass plates over cracks.

Inspection of premises was undertaken by me on 8th July 2013 which I viewed the damage and observed tell-tale glass plates had not cracked indicated no movement post installation had occurred."
"Inspection was undertaken at the subject property in the presence of the Insured to which the following observations was noted:    Swimming Pool Structure    The pool construction consists of metal sheets carcass and supporting uprights which has been lined with a plastic waterproof membrane and Styrofoam panels utilised as stairs.     At time of inspection, the Styrofoam stairs were observed to have uplifted together with the polyurethane liners and separation of horizontal coping members at the butting joint. Images 4 -6     In our opinion, the construction of the pool is typical of a pre-fabricated â€œabove groundâ€ swimming pool system.    The embedment of the pool structure into the ground has resulted in â€œin-groundâ€ application of the subject pool system contrary to the â€œabove-groundâ€ intended design and function.    In saying this, in contrast to â€œin-groundâ€ pool systems, â€œabove-groundâ€ pool systems are not generally designed to withstand soil and hydrostatic pressures from the exterior of the pool and have been designed for containment of pool water pressure only.    In this case, the exerted earth and hydrostatic pressure onto the pool carcass associated with its construction in an â€œin-groundâ€ system capacity is beyond the design function and intent of an â€œabove groundâ€ pool structure and its carcass.     In illustrating the mechanism of failure, we have provided a schematic diagram of the earth pressure and hydrostatic pressures acting on the external face of the pool structure in Figure 2.        Figure 2 - Schematic Diagram of Resultant Internal & External Pressures Acting on the Pool Structure and Carcass Resulting in the Buckling and Damage as Observed.    On the above basis, the imbalance of the pressure between the earth pressure and the hydrostatic pressure from the water in the pool has ultimately exceeded equilibrium within the pool structureâ€™s stability causing failure and buckling about section of the carcass and liners as experienced.    The loss of equilibrium between the resisting internal pressure and the applied external pressure has caused imbalance and ultimately the loss of the pool structureâ€™s integrity.     As such, saturation of the backfill material during the experienced storm together with hydrostatic build-up against the pool carcass has exceeded the design capacity of the pool structure resulting in the observed failure and buckling of the pool liner and uplift of the Styrofoam stairs.    In our opinion the movement of the carcass has allowed for the disengagement of the polyurethane membrane allowing water to enter below the Styrofoam staircase and cause the experienced uplift.     In our opinion, the subject â€œabove groundâ€ pool system was not designed to be used for â€œin-groundâ€ application.     In addition, the use of the Styrofoam stairs is grossly inadequate and unsuitable as the density of Styrofoam is very low compared to water, making it buoyant during saturation of foundation material.     In saying this, if the pool was correctly constructed as an in-ground pool using concrete wall or fibreglass in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s specification, the observed damage would not have occurred irrespective of the severity of the storm.     On the above basis, the observed damage is unrelated to an insurable event and the failure can be solely contributed to the inadequacy of the pool construction constructed 11 months ago adopting above ground pool system for in ground application.",NA,undefined
